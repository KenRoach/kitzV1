# New Customer Onboarding SOP v1

**Owner:** HeadGrowth Agent
**Type:** business

## Summary
First contact to first value in under 10 minutes.

## Steps
1. **Welcome message** — "Hey! Let's get your business set up." Keep it warm.
2. **Collect basics** — Business name, what they sell, WhatsApp number. That's it.
3. **Create workspace** — Set up CRM contact + first pipeline stage.
4. **Show first value** — Import their first 3 contacts or create their first checkout link.
5. **Breakthrough moment** — When they see THEIR data in the system. That's the hook.
6. **Set next step** — "Tomorrow I'll check in. What's your biggest headache right now?"

## Rules
- Under 10 minutes or you've lost them
- Don't overwhelm — 3 things max in first session
- Spanish first unless they message in English
- The breakthrough moment is non-negotiable — they must see their own data
