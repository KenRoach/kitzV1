# First 10 Users — WhatsApp Invite Strategy

**Owner:** CMO Agent + HeadGrowth Agent
**Channel:** WhatsApp (primary), Instagram DM (secondary)
**Budget:** $0 (scrappy_free_first policy — validate before spending)
**Timeline:** 2 weeks to 10 activated users
**Activation metric:** User sees their own data in the system (< 10 min)

## Strategy: "Your Chaos, Our System"

### Why WhatsApp-First
- Target users (25-45, LatAm) already run their entire business on WhatsApp
- They lose orders in chat threads. They forget follow-ups. They can't track revenue.
- KITZ doesn't ask them to change behavior — it meets them where they are

### The 10-User Cohort (Prioritized)

| # | Profile | Business | Country | Why First |
|---|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Kenneth's network | Food/service | Panama | Founder's warm contacts — highest trust |
| 2 | MealKitz alumni | Food delivery | Panama | Know Kenneth, lived the pain |
| 3 | Market vendor | Fresh produce | Panama City | High order volume, WhatsApp-native |
| 4 | Nail/beauty salon | Beauty services | Panama/CR | Appointment + order tracking pain |
| 5 | Food truck operator | Street food | Panama | Mobile-first, needs checkout links |
| 6 | Boutique seller | Fashion/clothing | Colombia | Instagram + WhatsApp sales funnel |
| 7 | Tutor/teacher | Education services | Panama | Scheduling + payment collection |
| 8 | Delivery runner | Logistics | Panama City | Order tracking is their whole business |
| 9 | Event planner | Events/catering | Panama | Multi-order, multi-contact chaos |
| 10 | Hardware/supplies | Retail | Guatemala/DR | Inventory + order tracking |

### The 3-Touch Invite Sequence

**Touch 1: The Hook (Day 0)**
Personal WhatsApp message from Kenneth. NOT a mass blast.
One contact at a time. Feels like a friend sharing a tool.

**Touch 2: The Activation (Day 0-1)**
If they reply positively: send workspace link + walk them through adding their first contact.
Target: < 10 minutes to breakthrough moment (seeing their data in the system).

**Touch 3: The Check-in (Day 3)**
Quick follow-up: "How's it going? Need help?" + show them one feature they haven't tried.
If they added contacts: suggest orders or checkout links.
If they dropped off: ask what got confusing (feeds back to product).

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Draft-first**: Every message goes through Kenneth for approval before sending. No auto-blasts.
2. **One at a time**: Max 2-3 invites per day. This is personal outreach, not spam.
3. **No pressure**: If someone says "not now" — respect it. Follow up in 2 weeks max.
4. **Free tier only**: Never mention AI credits or paid tier in the first 10. Let them discover value first.
5. **Track everything**: Log each invite, response, activation, and drop-off in the CRM.
6. **Listen more than sell**: Every conversation is product research. What do they struggle with?

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Invite acceptance rate | 70%+ (7/10) | Replied positively |
| Activation rate | 60%+ (6/10) | Added first contact + action |
| Day-7 retention | 40%+ (4/10) | Returned to workspace in week 2 |
| Breakthrough moment | < 10 min | Time from link click to first data entry |
| NPS feedback | 8+ | "Would you recommend this?" |

## What We Learn From Each User

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| What did they try first? | Reveals priority feature |
| Where did they get stuck? | UX friction points |
| What did they wish it had? | Roadmap input |
| Would they tell a friend? | Organic growth signal |
| Do they want AI features? | Paid tier demand signal |

## Escalation to AI Tier

After a user has been active for 7+ days on free tier:
1. Observe their usage patterns (contacts added, orders created, checkout links used)
2. Identify a task that AI could automate (e.g., "follow up with 5 leads who haven't replied")
3. Offer: "Want me to handle that? 100 AI credits = $5. Saves you ~2 hours."
4. ROI framing: $5 saves 2 hours = $2.50/hour. If their time is worth more, it's a no-brainer.

**Never push paid until free tier value is proven.**
