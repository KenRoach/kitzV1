## Phase 1: Presentation Quality Rubric

### Scoring Overview

Every deck generated by `deck_create` should be evaluated across 10 dimensions on a 1-5 scale. The AI agent uses this rubric both during generation (to guide content decisions) and post-generation (to self-score and iterate).

| Score | Label       | Meaning                                                  |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Poor        | Fails the dimension entirely; would harm the presentation |
| 2     | Below Average | Partially addresses the dimension; noticeable gaps       |
| 3     | Acceptable  | Meets baseline expectations; functional but not impressive |
| 4     | Good        | Exceeds baseline; demonstrates craft and intentionality   |
| 5     | Excellent   | Best-in-class for this dimension; presentation-ready      |

**Minimum passing score:** 3.0 average across all dimensions (30/50 total).
**Target for shipping:** 4.0 average across all dimensions (40/50 total).

### Dimension 1: Story Arc

**What it measures:** Whether the deck follows a coherent narrative structure that guides the audience from problem awareness through to a clear call to action. The canonical arc is Problem, Solution, Evidence, CTA, though variations are acceptable if the logical flow remains intact.

**Relevance to templates:**
- `investor-pitch`: Problem, Solution, Market, Product, Traction, Model, Team, Financials, Ask
- `sales-proposal`: Challenge, Approach, Features, Pricing, Timeline, Testimonial, Next Steps
- `business-overview`: About, Services, Portfolio, Team, Contact

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | Slides are in random order with no logical progression. The problem is never stated, or the solution appears before the problem. The audience has no sense of where the deck is going. | A sales-proposal deck that opens with pricing, then shows the team, then describes the challenge, then jumps to a testimonial. The audience is confused about what problem is being solved and why the price matters. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | The deck follows a recognizable structure and the audience can follow along. Problem and solution are present but the connection between evidence slides and the CTA could be stronger. Some slides feel out of place but do not derail the narrative. | An investor-pitch deck that covers Problem, Solution, Market, Traction, Ask in order, but the Team slide is wedged between Traction and Financials, breaking momentum before the ask. The story is followable but not compelling. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Every slide builds on the previous one. The narrative arc creates mounting urgency or excitement. The transition from evidence to CTA feels inevitable. The audience could summarize the story in one sentence after seeing the deck. | An investor-pitch deck where Problem establishes urgency, Solution shows a clear fix, Market proves the opportunity is large, Traction proves the team can execute, Financials show efficient growth, and The Ask feels like a natural conclusion. Each slide's title could be read in sequence as a coherent story outline. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Extract the sequence of slide titles from the `DeckData.slides` array.
2. Classify each title into a narrative phase: Setup (problem/context), Proposition (solution/approach), Evidence (data/proof/testimonials), and Resolution (CTA/next steps).
3. Verify that the phases appear in the canonical order: Setup before Proposition, Proposition before Evidence, Evidence before Resolution.
4. Penalize: slides in the wrong phase position (-1 per misplaced slide), missing phases (-1 per missing phase), Resolution not being the final slide (-1).
5. Bonus: if every slide title, when read in sequence, forms a readable narrative summary (+1).

---

### Dimension 2: Visual Hierarchy

**What it measures:** Whether the information hierarchy on each slide is immediately clear through typography, size, color, and placement. The viewer's eye should follow a predictable path: title first, then subtitle or key point, then supporting body text, then metadata or captions.

**Hierarchy order:** Titles > Subheadings > Body Text > Captions/Metadata

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | All text is the same size and weight. Nothing stands out as the primary message. The viewer's eye wanders without landing on a focal point. Stats are buried in paragraph text. | A content slide where the title is 18px regular weight, the bullets are 18px regular weight, and there is no visual distinction between the slide heading and the supporting points. Everything blends together. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Titles are larger and bolder than body text. There is a clear primary focal point on each slide. However, secondary hierarchy levels (subtitle vs. body vs. caption) are not consistently differentiated. | A stats slide where the title is clearly larger (32px bold), but the stat values and stat labels are the same size (both 20px), making it hard to quickly scan the numbers versus their descriptions. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Each slide has 3-4 clearly distinct hierarchy levels. Titles are dominant (36-44px bold), stat numbers are the largest elements on stats slides (48-64px extra-bold), body text is comfortable (18-22px), and captions/footers are understated (12-14px). The viewer can extract the key message in under 2 seconds. | A stats slide where "Traction" is the title at 32px bold in brand primary, the stat values are 48px extra-bold in white on brand-colored cards, the stat labels are 14px at 80% opacity below the values, and the slide number footer is 11px in light gray. The eye immediately goes: Title, Numbers, Labels, Footer. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Parse the rendered HTML for each slide and extract all text elements with their computed `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `color`.
2. Sort elements by visual weight (size times weight factor: 800=1.0, 700=0.85, 600=0.7, 400=0.5).
3. Verify that at least 3 distinct hierarchy levels exist per slide.
4. Check that the title element has the highest visual weight on content/stats/comparison slides.
5. Check that stat values have the highest visual weight on stats slides (they should exceed the title).
6. Penalize: fewer than 2 hierarchy levels (-2), title not dominant (-1), all text same size (-2).

---

### Dimension 3: Data Visualization

**What it measures:** Whether numerical data, statistics, and metrics are presented in a visually compelling and scannable way, rather than buried in bullet lists or paragraph text. Stats should be the hero of their slide.

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | Numbers are embedded in sentences or bullet points with no visual treatment. The viewer has to read full sentences to find the data. No stat cards, no visual emphasis on figures. | A traction slide that reads: "We currently have 12,000 users. Our monthly recurring revenue is $45,000. We are growing at 25% month over month." All in 18px regular body text. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Stats are separated into their own elements (e.g., stat cards or labeled values), but they lack visual punch. The numbers are present and findable but do not immediately grab attention. Formatting is functional but plain. | A stats slide with three cards showing "Users: 12,000", "MRR: $45,000", "Growth: 25%" each at 24px, but the label and value are the same size and weight. The cards exist but the numbers do not pop. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Stats are presented in bold, oversized type (48-64px) on visually distinct cards with brand-colored backgrounds. Labels are smaller and subordinate. The numbers are the first thing the eye hits. Supporting context is minimal and does not compete with the data. | A stats slide with three cards on brand-primary background: "12K" at 56px extra-bold white, "Users" at 14px at 80% opacity below; "$45K" at 56px, "MRR" at 14px below; "25%" at 56px, "MoM Growth" at 14px below. The three numbers read like a dashboard. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Identify all slides with `type: 'stats'` in the `DeckData.slides` array.
2. In the rendered HTML, locate stat value elements and measure their font-size relative to other text on the same slide.
3. Verify stat values are at least 2x the body text size.
4. Check that stat values use card-based layouts (look for container elements with `background`, `border-radius`, and `padding`).
5. Verify that stat labels are visually subordinate (smaller font-size, lower opacity, or lighter color).
6. Penalize: stats in bullet lists (-2), stats same size as body text (-1), no visual containment (-1).
7. Bonus: stat values use abbreviated format (e.g., "$45K" instead of "$45,000") for scannability (+0.5).

---

### Dimension 4: Slide Density

**What it measures:** Whether each slide is focused on a single idea with appropriate content volume. Overloaded slides overwhelm the audience; underloaded slides waste their time. Target: maximum 3 key points per slide, approximately 40 words per content slide.

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | Slides are walls of text with 6+ bullet points, long sentences, or multiple unrelated ideas crammed into a single slide. Over 80 words of body text per slide. The audience cannot process the information during the presentation. | A "Solution" slide with 8 bullet points, each a full sentence: "Our platform provides real-time analytics that help you understand customer behavior patterns across multiple channels and touchpoints, enabling data-driven decision making at every level of your organization..." (200+ words total). |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Slides have 3-4 bullet points with moderate-length text. The content is relevant but could be tightened. Word count is 40-60 per content slide. One main idea per slide, though supporting points sometimes drift. | A "Solution" slide with 4 bullets: "AI-powered analytics dashboard", "Real-time customer insights across channels", "Automated reporting and alerts", "Integration with existing CRM tools". Clear but slightly dense; the fourth point could be its own slide or cut. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Each slide makes exactly one point with 2-3 crisp supporting items. Content slides stay under 40 words. The audience can absorb the slide in 5-8 seconds. Every word earns its place. | A "Solution" slide with 3 bullets: "See every customer interaction in one view", "Get alerts before problems escalate", "Save 10 hours/week on manual reporting". Three punchy benefits, under 30 words total, each starting with an action verb. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. For each slide in `DeckData.slides`, count: number of bullets (for content type), number of stats (for stats type), total word count of all text content.
2. Apply thresholds:
   - Bullets per slide: 1-3 = good, 4 = acceptable, 5+ = poor
   - Words per content slide: under 40 = good, 40-60 = acceptable, 60+ = poor
   - Stats per stats slide: 2-4 = good, 5+ = poor
3. Calculate per-slide density scores and average across all slides.
4. Penalize: any slide over 80 words (-1 per slide), any slide with 6+ bullets (-1 per slide).
5. Bonus: all slides under 35 words with 3 or fewer bullets (+1).

---

### Dimension 5: Brand Consistency

**What it measures:** Whether the deck consistently applies the business's brand kit (colors, fonts, tone, logo) throughout every slide. Inconsistency makes a business look unprofessional.

**Brand kit properties (from `BrandKit` interface in `contentEngine.ts`):**
- `colors`: primary, secondary, accent, background, text
- `fonts`: heading, body
- `tone`: professional, casual, bold, elegant
- `tagline`, `logo`, `contactInfo`

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | Brand colors are absent or used incorrectly. Default browser fonts appear. The deck could belong to any business. No logo, no business name beyond the title slide. Contact information is missing from the CTA. | A deck for "Panaderia Luna" that uses black text on white throughout, with Times New Roman font, no purple/gold brand colors, and the closing CTA slide says "Get in touch" with no email, phone, or business name. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Brand primary color is used for titles. Brand fonts are loaded. Business name appears on the title slide and in the footer. However, secondary and accent colors are unused or misapplied. Tone is inconsistent (e.g., brand tone is "elegant" but copy is casual). | A deck for "Panaderia Luna" that uses the brand purple (#A855F7) for all titles, Inter font throughout, and the business name in footers. But the accent gold (#F59E0B) never appears, stat cards are plain white instead of brand-colored, and the CTA button is generic gray. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | All five brand colors are used purposefully: primary for titles and CTA buttons, secondary for subtitles and accents, accent for highlights and emphasis, background and text as specified. Fonts match the brand kit. Tone of copy matches the brand tone setting. Logo appears on title and CTA slides. Contact info appears on the closing slide. Every slide feels like it belongs to this business. | A deck for "Panaderia Luna" where titles are 44px Inter bold in #A855F7, subtitles are #7C3AED, stat cards have #A855F7 backgrounds, the CTA button is #A855F7 with white text, bullet accents use #F59E0B, body text is #0A0A0A on #FFFFFF, the tagline "Tu negocio merece infraestructura" appears on the title slide, and the CTA slide includes phone, email, and address from `contactInfo`. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Retrieve the active `BrandKit` via `getBrandKit(orgId)`.
2. Parse all rendered HTML and extract every color value used (from `color`, `background`, `background-color` properties).
3. Verify: brand primary appears in titles and CTA elements, brand secondary appears at least once, brand accent appears at least once, background matches brand background, text color matches brand text.
4. Verify: `font-family` declarations reference the brand's heading and body fonts.
5. Check: business name appears in at least 2 slides (title + footer or CTA), contact info present on CTA slide if available in brand kit.
6. Score: Each missing brand color usage = -0.5, wrong font = -1, missing business name on CTA = -0.5, tone mismatch = -1.

---

### Dimension 6: Audience Alignment

**What it measures:** Whether the content, language, data points, and emphasis are tailored to the specific audience the deck is addressing. An investor deck, a sales proposal, and a business overview should feel fundamentally different even for the same business.

**Template-audience mapping:**
- `investor-pitch` — Investors: emphasize market size, traction, team, financials, return potential
- `sales-proposal` — Prospective customers: emphasize their pain points, your solution, proof, pricing
- `business-overview` — General audience: emphasize capabilities, experience, breadth

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | The deck uses the wrong frame entirely. An investor deck that never mentions market size or financials. A sales proposal that talks about the team's backgrounds instead of the client's problems. Content reads as generic, one-size-fits-all. | An investor-pitch deck for a bakery software company where the slides discuss "Our delicious bread recipes" and "How to bake sourdough" instead of TAM/SAM/SOM, MRR, or growth metrics. The audience (investors) has no information to make a funding decision. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | The deck addresses the right topics for the audience but lacks specificity. Investor decks mention market size but use vague terms ("large market"). Sales proposals describe the client's problem but in generic terms. The content is on-topic but could apply to many businesses. | An investor-pitch deck that says "The market is large and growing" on the Market Size slide, "We have strong traction" on the Traction slide, and "We have an experienced team" on the Team slide. All true but none specific. An investor would ask follow-up questions on every slide. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Every slide is tuned to what this specific audience cares about. Investor decks lead with the metrics investors evaluate (TAM in dollars, MRR with growth rate, burn rate and runway). Sales proposals open with the prospect's specific pain and close with a clear pricing/timeline path. Language matches audience expectations (formal for investors, benefit-driven for customers). | An investor-pitch deck for a bakery POS system: Market Size shows "$4.2B TAM (LatAm food service tech), $380M SAM (bakery-specific POS), $28M SOM (Year 3 target)". Traction shows "1,200 active bakeries, $67K MRR, 18% MoM growth". The Ask: "Raising $2M Series Seed at $12M pre-money for LatAm expansion". Every number is investable. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Identify the template from `DeckData.template`.
2. Define required content signals per template:
   - `investor-pitch`: must contain numeric TAM/SAM/SOM or market size figures, revenue/MRR numbers, growth percentage, team credentials, a specific funding ask with amount
   - `sales-proposal`: must reference client pain points (not generic), include pricing figures, include a timeline, include a testimonial or proof point
   - `business-overview`: must include service descriptions, experience metrics, contact details
3. Count how many required signals are present with specific (non-placeholder) values.
4. Score: all signals present with specifics = 5, all present but vague = 3, signals missing = proportional deduction.
5. Check language register: investor decks should avoid casual language, sales proposals should use second-person ("you/your"), business overviews should use third-person.

---

### Dimension 7: Call-to-Action Clarity

**What it measures:** Whether the final slide (and the deck's overall momentum) drives the audience toward a clear, specific, compelling next step. A great deck with a weak CTA wastes the audience's attention.

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | No CTA slide exists, or the CTA is vague ("Thank you" with no next step). No contact information. The audience finishes the deck without knowing what to do next. | The deck ends with a "Thank You" slide showing only the company logo. No email, no phone, no scheduling link, no specific ask. The audience claps politely and forgets about it. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | A CTA slide exists with a general action ("Contact us", "Get in touch"). Contact information is present. However, the CTA does not specify what happens next or create urgency. The button text is generic. | A CTA slide titled "Next Steps" with a button reading "Get in touch" and an email address below. Functional but passive. The audience knows they could contact the business but has no compelling reason to do so right now. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | The CTA slide has a specific, time-bound, low-friction next step. The button text is action-oriented and specific to the audience. Contact information is complete. The CTA connects back to the value established earlier in the deck. | An investor-pitch CTA: title "Join Our Series Seed", button "Schedule a 30-min Partner Call", with email and calendar link below, and a one-line reinforcement: "1,200 bakeries already trust us -- be part of what comes next." A sales-proposal CTA: "Start Your 14-Day Pilot", button "Book Your Onboarding Call", with the account manager's direct email and phone. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Check that the last slide in `DeckData.slides` has `type: 'cta'`.
2. Evaluate the `ctaText` field:
   - Generic phrases ("Get started", "Contact us", "Get in touch") = score 2-3
   - Specific action phrases ("Schedule a call", "Book a demo", "Start your trial") = score 4
   - Specific + time-bound + audience-tailored = score 5
3. Check for presence of `contactInfo` (email, phone) on the CTA slide render.
4. Check if the CTA title connects thematically to earlier slides (keyword overlap with problem/solution slides).
5. Penalize: no CTA slide (-3), generic ctaText (-1), missing contact info (-0.5), CTA disconnected from deck narrative (-1).

---

### Dimension 8: White Space and Layout

**What it measures:** Whether each slide has adequate breathing room for comfortable reading and visual processing. Crowded slides feel chaotic and unprofessional. The target is more than 30% white space per slide (area not occupied by text, images, or visual elements).

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | Slides are packed edge-to-edge with content. Minimal padding, tight line spacing, no margins around content blocks. Text runs close to slide edges. The slide feels claustrophobic and overwhelming. | A content slide with 12px padding, 8 bullet points in 16px text with 4px line spacing, text starting 12px from the left edge and ending 12px from the right. Less than 15% of the slide is empty space. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Reasonable padding exists (32-40px). Content does not touch the edges. There is some space between elements. However, the slide still feels slightly crowded, particularly on content-heavy slides. Approximately 25-30% white space. | A content slide with 40px padding, 4 bullets with 12px spacing between them. The content block occupies about 70% of the slide. Readable but not elegant. Moving to 3 bullets or increasing spacing would improve it. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Generous padding (48-56px) on all sides. Clear space between every element (24-32px). Content occupies 60-65% of the slide at most. The slide feels calm, confident, and easy to scan. Stats cards have internal padding. Footer is well-positioned with clear separation from content. | A content slide with 48px side padding, 56px top padding, 3 bullets with 16px spacing between them, 32px gap between title and first bullet. The content block uses about 55% of the slide area. The footer sits at bottom-right with 16px from the edge, visually separated from the main content by at least 40px of clear space. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Parse the rendered HTML for each slide and calculate the approximate content area:
   - Total slide area = width x min-height (from `slideWrapper`: 100% x 600px)
   - Content area = sum of bounding boxes of all text/visual elements
2. Calculate white space percentage = (total area - content area) / total area x 100.
3. Check CSS padding values on the slide wrapper (target: 48-56px, from `slideWrapper` function).
4. Check spacing between elements (target: 24-32px between major elements, 10-16px between bullet items).
5. Score: >35% white space = 5, 30-35% = 4, 25-30% = 3, 20-25% = 2, <20% = 1.
6. Bonus: consistent spacing rhythm throughout all slides (+0.5).

---

### Dimension 9: Transition Flow

**What it measures:** Whether slides connect logically to one another, creating a smooth reading experience. Each slide should feel like a natural continuation of the previous one. The audience should never think "wait, why are we talking about this now?"

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | Slides feel randomly shuffled. No logical connector between consecutive slides. The audience experiences cognitive whiplash jumping between unrelated topics. | Slide 3: "Our Pricing" (showing plan tiers) followed by Slide 4: "The Problem" (describing market pain). Then Slide 5: "Our Team" followed by Slide 6: "Customer Testimonial". No logical thread connects any pair of consecutive slides. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | Most slide transitions make sense within the overall template structure. The audience can follow along. However, 1-2 transitions feel abrupt or the connection is unclear. No explicit bridging language between slides. | An investor-pitch deck where "Market Size" (with TAM/SAM/SOM) transitions to "The Product" (features). The connection exists (the product serves this market) but is not made explicit. The audience infers the link rather than being guided through it. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Every slide builds directly on the previous one. Titles create a readable sequence. Where possible, the last bullet or sentence of one slide sets up the topic of the next. The deck reads like a conversation, not a collection of slides. | "The Problem" ends with "Bakeries need a modern solution" and the next slide is "Our Solution" starting with "That is exactly what BakeryOS delivers". "Traction" ends with impressive growth numbers, and "Financials" opens by contextualizing those numbers into a revenue model. Each slide hands off to the next. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Extract all slide titles in order from `DeckData.slides`.
2. For each consecutive pair (slide N, slide N+1), evaluate semantic relatedness:
   - Check if the title of slide N+1 is a logical follow-up to slide N's title and content
   - Look for bridging keywords (e.g., "Solution" naturally follows "Problem", "Pricing" follows "Features")
3. Compare the actual slide order against the template's canonical order (from `DECK_TEMPLATES`).
4. Check the last bullet/text of each slide and the first element of the next for thematic continuity.
5. Score: all transitions semantically smooth = 5, 1 awkward transition = 4, 2 awkward = 3, 3+ awkward = 2, random order = 1.
6. Templates provide a natural flow baseline; custom slide orders must justify deviations.

---

### Dimension 10: Opening Impact

**What it measures:** Whether the first 3 slides capture the audience's attention and establish the deck's credibility. The opening must hook interest, establish context, and create a reason to keep watching.

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1 (Poor)** | The deck opens with a generic title slide ("Presentation" or just the company name with no tagline), followed by an "About Us" slide with biographical details nobody asked for. By slide 3, the audience still does not know what the deck is about or why they should care. | Slide 1: "ABC Company" (no tagline, no visual). Slide 2: "About Us -- Founded in 2019, we are a team of 12 based in Mexico City." Slide 3: "Our Mission -- To leverage synergistic paradigms for holistic business transformation." The audience checks their phone. |
| **3 (Acceptable)** | The title slide includes the business name and a functional tagline. Slide 2 introduces the topic (problem or context). Slide 3 begins to address it. The opening is competent but does not create urgency or excitement. | Slide 1: "BakeryOS -- Software for bakeries" (functional tagline). Slide 2: "The Challenge -- Bakeries struggle with inventory and ordering." Slide 3: "Our Approach -- We built a simple POS system." The audience understands what the deck is about but is not particularly intrigued. |
| **5 (Excellent)** | The title slide has a compelling tagline or value proposition that creates curiosity. Slide 2 presents a vivid, specific problem or opportunity that the audience immediately relates to. Slide 3 introduces the solution or key insight with enough specificity to establish credibility. By slide 3, the audience is leaning forward. | Slide 1: "BakeryOS -- 1,200 bakeries stopped losing inventory overnight" (curiosity + proof). Slide 2: "The Problem -- Latin American bakeries lose $2,400/month to spoilage, manual errors, and supplier miscommunication" (specific, quantified pain). Slide 3: "Our Solution -- One tablet replaces the clipboard, the calculator, and the phone call" (vivid, concrete). The audience wants to see the next slide. |

**AI Auto-Evaluation Method:**
1. Examine the first 3 slides from `DeckData.slides`.
2. Slide 1 (title):
   - Has a tagline or subtitle beyond just the business name (+1)
   - Tagline contains a number, proof point, or provocative claim (+1)
   - Tagline is specific to the business (not generic like "Your trusted partner") (+0.5)
3. Slide 2:
   - Addresses a problem or context relevant to the audience (+1)
   - Contains at least one specific data point or vivid detail (+0.5)
4. Slide 3:
   - Introduces a solution, insight, or value proposition (+1)
   - Is specific enough to establish credibility (not vague) (+0.5)
5. Penalize: generic title with no tagline (-1), slide 2 is "About Us" instead of problem/context (-1), first 3 slides contain no numbers or specifics (-1).

| 1.0 - 1.9    | Failed        | Discard and start over. Likely a brief or template mismatch. |

#### Dimension Weights for Weighted Scoring (Optional)

For a more nuanced evaluation, apply these weights based on audience impact:

| Dimension             | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|
| Story Arc             | 1.5x   | Narrative structure is the foundation of a compelling deck |
| Visual Hierarchy      | 1.0x   | Standard importance |
| Data Visualization    | 1.0x   | Standard importance |
| Slide Density         | 1.2x   | Overloaded slides are a common AI failure mode |
| Brand Consistency     | 1.0x   | Standard importance (largely handled by `injectBrandCSS`) |
| Audience Alignment    | 1.5x   | Wrong audience framing wastes the entire deck |
| Call-to-Action Clarity| 1.3x   | The CTA is the business outcome of the deck |
| White Space & Layout  | 0.8x   | Important but mostly handled by CSS defaults |
| Transition Flow       | 1.0x   | Standard importance |
| Opening Impact        | 1.2x   | First impressions disproportionately affect engagement |

```
Weighted Score = sum(dimension_score * weight) / sum(weights)
```

#### Auto-Iteration Protocol

When the AI scores a generated deck below 4.0 average:

1. Identify the 3 lowest-scoring dimensions.
2. Generate a targeted `content_edit` instruction for each, referencing the specific slide(s) that dragged the score down.
3. Re-run `deck_create` or `content_edit` with the improvement instructions.
4. Re-score. If still below 4.0 after 2 iterations, flag for human review.

## Phase 3: Visual System for Presentations

This section defines the visual design system that the `deckTools.ts` rendering engine should follow. All values reference the existing `slideWrapper`, `renderSlide`, and `injectBrandCSS` functions.

---

### Typography Scale

All sizes are specified in `px` for HTML rendering consistency. The `deck_export` tool renders to a 960px-wide container.

| Element | Size | Weight | Font | Color | Usage |
|---------|------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Slide title (title slide) | 44px | 800 (extra-bold) | `var(--font-heading)` | `var(--brand-primary)` | The company/deck name on the opening title slide |
| Slide title (other slides) | 32-36px | 700 (bold) | `var(--font-heading)` | `var(--brand-primary)` | Section headings on content, stats, comparison, quote, CTA slides |
| Subtitle / tagline | 24-28px | 600 (semibold) | `var(--font-heading)` | `var(--brand-secondary)` | Taglines on title slides, section subtitles |
| Body text / bullets | 18-22px | 400 (regular) | `var(--font-body)` | `var(--brand-text)` | Bullet points, descriptive paragraphs, comparison column items |
| Caption / metadata | 12-14px | 400 (regular) | `var(--font-body)` | `#999` or 60% opacity | Slide numbers, footer text, attributions, small labels |
| Stat values | 48-64px | 800 (extra-bold) | `var(--font-heading)` | `#FFFFFF` (on brand bg) | Hero numbers on stats slides (TAM, MRR, growth %, etc.) |
| Stat labels | 14px | 400 (regular) | `var(--font-body)` | `#FFFFFF` at 80% opacity | Labels beneath stat values on stats cards |
| CTA button text | 18px | 600 (semibold) | `var(--font-body)` | `#FFFFFF` | Text inside the call-to-action button |
| Quote text | 24px | 400 italic | `var(--font-body)` | `var(--brand-text)` | Testimonial or quote body text |
| Quote attribution | 16px | 400 (regular) | `var(--font-body)` | `var(--brand-secondary)` | The "-- Client Name" line below a quote |

#### Current vs. Target Alignment

The current `deckTools.ts` implementation is mostly aligned. Key adjustments needed:

| Element | Current (deckTools.ts) | Target | Gap |
|---------|----------------------|--------|-----|
| Content slide title | 32px / 700 | 32-36px / 700 | Aligned (could increase to 36px for emphasis) |
| Stats value | 36px / 800 | 48-64px / 800 | **Needs increase** -- stat values should be larger |
| Stats label | 14px / 80% opacity | 14px / 80% opacity | Aligned |
| Body text (bullets) | 18px / regular | 18-22px / regular | Aligned |
| Quote text | 24px / italic | 24px / italic | Aligned |
| Subtitle on title slide | 20px / regular | 24-28px / 600 | **Needs increase** in size and weight |
| Footer/slide number | 11px | 12-14px | Minor increase recommended |

---

### Color Usage Rules

Colors are injected via CSS custom properties from `injectBrandCSS()` in `contentEngine.ts`. The brand kit defines five color roles.

#### Color Role Assignments

| Color Role | CSS Variable | Default Value | Where to Use | Where NOT to Use |
|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Primary** | `--brand-primary` | `#A855F7` | Slide titles, stat card backgrounds, CTA buttons, bullet accent marks, heading decorations | Body text, backgrounds of content slides |
| **Secondary** | `--brand-secondary` | `#7C3AED` | Subtitles, hover states, comparison column headers, quote attributions, secondary accents | Primary titles, CTA buttons |
| **Accent** | `--brand-accent` | `#F59E0B` | Bullet markers, highlight elements, emphasis text, small decorative touches, data callouts | Large background areas, body text |
| **Background** | `--brand-bg` | `#FFFFFF` | Slide backgrounds, card backgrounds (inverted on stats cards) | Text color |
| **Text** | `--brand-text` | `#0A0A0A` | Body text, bullet text, comparison items | Headings (use primary instead), backgrounds |

#### The 3-Color-Per-Slide Rule

No single slide should use more than 3 distinct colors (excluding white/near-white and black/near-black). This prevents visual noise and maintains brand cohesion.

| Slide Type | Recommended 3-Color Palette |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| title      | Primary (title), Secondary (subtitle), Neutral (#999 for metadata) |
| content    | Primary (title), Accent (bullet markers), Text (body) |
| stats      | Primary (card backgrounds + title), White (stat text on cards), Text (if any body text) |
| comparison | Primary (title), Secondary (left column header), Accent (right column header) |
| quote      | Primary (quotation mark), Text (quote body), Secondary (attribution) |
| cta        | Primary (title + button), White (button text), Neutral (#999 for contact info) |

#### Color Contrast Requirements

- Text on brand-colored backgrounds must maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA).
- White text (`#FFFFFF`) on the default primary (`#A855F7`) has a contrast ratio of approximately 3.6:1 -- this should be monitored. If the user sets a lighter primary, stat card text may need to switch to dark.
- Body text (`--brand-text: #0A0A0A`) on background (`--brand-bg: #FFFFFF`) meets AAA standards (21:1).

#### Background Variations

| Context | Background | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Standard slide background | `var(--brand-bg)` or `#FFFFFF` | Default for all slide types |
| Stats card background | `var(--brand-primary)` | Inverted: white text on brand color |
| Alternate light background | `#FAFAFA` | For subtle contrast between sections |
| Footer area | Transparent | Sits over slide background, no separate background |
| CTA button | `var(--brand-primary)` | Solid brand color, white text |

---

### Layout Grids by Slide Type

Each slide type in `deckTools.ts` has a defined layout structure. The slide canvas is 960px wide with 48-56px padding on all sides, yielding approximately 848-864px of usable content width.

#### Title Slide

### Spacing Rules

Consistent spacing creates rhythm and professionalism. All values in pixels.

#### Slide-Level Spacing

| Property | Value | CSS Reference |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Slide padding (top/bottom) | 48px | `slideWrapper`: `padding: 48px 56px` |
| Slide padding (left/right) | 56px | `slideWrapper`: `padding: 48px 56px` |
| Slide minimum height | 600px | `slideWrapper`: `min-height: 600px` |
| Max content width | 960px | `deck_create`: `max-width: 960px` |

#### Element-Level Spacing

| Between | Gap | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Slide title and first content element | 24-32px | 24px for content slides, 32px for stats slides |
| Consecutive bullet items | 10px top + 10px bottom padding | Effective 20px gap via border-bottom separation |
| Stats cards (horizontal) | 24px | `flex` container `gap: 24px` |
| Comparison grid columns | 24px | `grid` `gap: 24px` |
| Comparison row items | 8px top + 8px bottom padding | Via padding on `<p>` elements |
| Quote text and attribution | 16px | `margin: 16px 0 0` on attribution |
| CTA title and button | 16px | `margin: 0 0 16px` on title |
| CTA button and contact info | 20px | `margin: 20px 0 0` on contact line |
| Contact info lines | 4px | `margin: 4px 0 0` between phone/email |

#### Footer Positioning

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Position | `absolute; bottom: 16px; right: 24px` | Anchored to bottom-right of slide |
| Font size | 11px (target: 12-14px) | Small and unobtrusive |
| Color | `#aaa` | Low contrast, does not compete with content |
| Content | `{businessName} . {slideNum}/{total}` | Brand presence + navigation context |

#### Spacing Rhythm Summary

The spacing system follows a 4px base unit with preferred values at:

```
4px   -- micro (between tightly coupled elements like contact info lines)
8px   -- small (comparison row padding, tight element gaps)
10-12px -- body (bullet item internal padding, caption sizes)
16px  -- medium (footer offset, CTA-to-contact gap, quote attribution gap)
24px  -- large (title-to-content gap, card gap, grid gap)
32px  -- extra-large (title-to-stats-cards gap)
48-56px -- slide (slide edge padding)
```

### Animation and Transition Recommendations

These recommendations are for future implementation. The current `deckTools.ts` generates static HTML with print-ready CSS. When interactive presentation mode is added, follow these guidelines.

#### Recommended Animations

| Animation | Use Case | CSS Implementation | Duration |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Fade-in | Content reveals on slide entry | `opacity: 0 -> 1` | 300-400ms |
| Slide-up fade | Bullet points appearing sequentially | `transform: translateY(20px); opacity: 0` -> `transform: translateY(0); opacity: 1` | 300ms per item, 100ms stagger |
| Scale-in | Stats cards appearing | `transform: scale(0.95); opacity: 0` -> `transform: scale(1); opacity: 1` | 400ms |
| Fade transition | Slide-to-slide transition | Cross-fade between slides | 400-500ms |
| Slide-left | Alternative slide transition | Current slide exits left, new slide enters from right | 400ms |

#### Animation Timing

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Easing function | `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)` (ease-out) | Smooth deceleration, feels natural |
| Content reveal delay | 200ms after slide transition completes | Ensures slide is settled before content animates |
| Sequential item stagger | 80-120ms between items | For bullet lists and stat cards |
| Maximum total animation time per slide | 1200ms | Prevents animations from feeling slow |

#### Prohibited Animations

The following effects are explicitly prohibited as they undermine professionalism:

- **Bounce effects** (`cubic-bezier` with overshoot) -- feels playful, not professional
- **Spin/rotate entrances** -- distracting, no informational value
- **3D flip transitions** -- gimmicky, can cause motion sickness
- **Zoom/fly-in from edges** -- aggressive, startling
- **Typewriter text effects** -- slow, frustrating for audiences
- **Particle effects or confetti** -- inappropriate for business context
- **Auto-advancing slides** -- removes audience/presenter control

#### CSS Implementation Template (Future)

```css
/* Base animation classes for future interactive mode */
.slide-enter {
  animation: slideIn 400ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) forwards;
}

@keyframes slideIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to   { opacity: 1; }
}

.content-reveal {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(16px);
  animation: contentReveal 300ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) forwards;
}

@keyframes contentReveal {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

/* Stagger delays for sequential items */
.content-reveal:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 200ms; }
.content-reveal:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 320ms; }
.content-reveal:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 440ms; }

/* Stat card scale-in */
.stat-card-enter {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.95);
  animation: statReveal 400ms cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) forwards;
}

@keyframes statReveal {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

/* Print mode: disable all animations */
@media print {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: none !important;
  }
}
```

### Implementation Mapping to deckTools.ts

This section maps each visual system rule back to the specific code location in `deckTools.ts` where it should be enforced or updated.

#### Current Code Reference Points

| Visual Rule | Function | Line Reference | Current State | Action Needed |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Slide padding 48px/56px | `slideWrapper()` | `padding:48px 56px` | Aligned | None |
| Slide min-height 600px | `slideWrapper()` | `min-height:600px` | Aligned | None |
| Title slide: 44px/800 | `renderSlide()` case `title` | `font-size:44px;font-weight:800` | Aligned | None |
| Content title: 32px/700 | `renderSlide()` case `content` | `font-size:32px;font-weight:700` | Aligned | Consider 36px |
| Body bullets: 18px | `renderSlide()` case `content` | `font-size:18px` | Aligned | None |
| Stat values: 36px/800 | `renderSlide()` case `stats` | `font-size:36px;font-weight:800` | **Below target** | Increase to 48-64px |
| Stat labels: 14px/80% | `renderSlide()` case `stats` | `font-size:14px;opacity:0.8` | Aligned | None |
| Stats card gap: 24px | `renderSlide()` case `stats` | `gap:24px` | Aligned | None |
| Stats card radius: 12px | `renderSlide()` case `stats` | `border-radius:12px` | Aligned | None |
| Comparison grid: 1fr 1fr | `renderSlide()` case `comparison` | `grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr` | Aligned | None |
| Quote: 24px italic centered | `renderSlide()` case `quote` | `font-size:24px;font-style:italic` | Aligned | None |
| Quote mark: 64px primary | `renderSlide()` case `quote` | `font-size:64px;color:var(--brand-primary)` | Aligned | None |
| CTA button: 14px/36px pad, 8px radius | `renderSlide()` case `cta` | `padding:14px 36px;border-radius:8px` | Aligned | None |
| Footer: bottom-right, 11px, #aaa | `slideWrapper()` | `bottom:16px;right:24px;font-size:11px;color:#aaa` | Mostly aligned | Increase to 12px |
| Subtitle on title: 20px | `renderSlide()` case `title` | `font-size:20px` | **Below target** | Increase to 24-28px, weight 600 |
| Brand CSS injection | `injectBrandCSS()` (contentEngine.ts) | CSS custom properties | Aligned | None |

#### Priority Changes

1. **High Priority -- Stat value size:** Change `font-size:36px` to `font-size:52px` in the stats slide renderer. This is the single highest-impact change for data visualization quality.

2. **Medium Priority -- Subtitle weight:** Change the title slide subtitle from `font-size:20px` with no explicit weight to `font-size:24px;font-weight:600;` for stronger visual hierarchy on the opening slide.

3. **Low Priority -- Footer size:** Increase footer from `font-size:11px` to `font-size:12px` for better readability on projected screens.

#### Suggested Code Changes

**Stats value size (in `renderSlide`, case `stats`):**
```typescript
// Current:
<div style="font-size:36px;font-weight:800">${s.value}</div>

// Target:
<div style="font-size:52px;font-weight:800;letter-spacing:-0.02em">${s.value}</div>
```

**Title slide subtitle (in `renderSlide`, case `title`):**
```typescript
// Current:
<p style="font-size:20px;color:var(--brand-secondary);margin:12px 0 0">${brand.tagline}</p>

// Target:
<p style="font-size:24px;font-weight:600;color:var(--brand-secondary);margin:16px 0 0">${brand.tagline}</p>
```

**Footer size (in `slideWrapper`):**
```typescript
// Current:
<div style="position:absolute;bottom:16px;right:24px;font-size:11px;color:#aaa">

// Target:
<div style="position:absolute;bottom:16px;right:24px;font-size:12px;color:#aaa">
```
