## 1. Visual Hierarchy

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 1.1 | **Type scale uses a minimum 1.25 ratio** between headline, subhead, and body sizes. Each step is visually distinct without needing to inspect computed styles. | Body 16px, Subhead 20px, Heading 25px, Display 31px -- each level is immediately distinguishable at a glance. | Body 16px, Subhead 17px, Heading 19px -- sizes are too close together and the hierarchy reads as flat. |
| 1.2 | **Maximum 3 font weights per page.** Use regular (400), medium (500), and bold (700). No other weights appear in the rendered output. | A settings page uses regular for body, medium for field labels, and bold for the page title. | A dashboard mixes thin (300), regular (400), medium (500), semibold (600), and bold (700) across different card headings with no governing logic. |
| 1.3 | **Primary action is clearly distinguished** from secondary and tertiary actions. Primary uses a filled purple button; secondary uses an outlined or muted variant; tertiary is text-only or link-styled. | A modal footer shows "Create Lead" as a filled purple button on the right and "Cancel" as a plain text button on the left. | Two buttons side by side -- "Save" and "Cancel" -- are both filled purple with identical visual weight. |
| 1.4 | **Icon sizes are consistent within context.** Inline text icons: 16px. Navigation icons: 20px. Hero/feature icons: 24px. No icon is arbitrarily sized. | Every sidebar nav item uses a 20px icon, left-aligned, with 8px gap to the label. | Sidebar icons vary between 18px, 22px, and 24px across different nav items with no system. |
| 1.5 | **Color is used purposefully for emphasis, not decoration.** Purple signals brand/primary actions. Red signals errors or destructive actions. Green signals success. Gray signals neutral/disabled. No color is applied without semantic meaning. | A status badge uses green for "Active," amber for "Pending," and red for "Overdue" -- each color maps to a specific meaning documented in the design system. | Card backgrounds alternate between purple, teal, and pink for visual variety with no relationship to the underlying data. |

## 2. Spacing System

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 2.1 | **All spacing values derive from a 4px base unit on an 8pt grid.** Valid values: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96. No arbitrary pixel values exist in the codebase. | Component padding uses `p-3` (12px), `p-4` (16px), or `p-6` (24px). Margins use `mt-8` (32px) or `mb-12` (48px). | A card uses `padding: 13px`, a heading has `margin-bottom: 7px`, or Tailwind classes like `px-[13px]` or `mt-[7px]` appear in the source. |
| 2.2 | **Consistent internal padding within components.** Cards, modals, dropdowns, and panels use one of the defined padding tiers: 12px (compact), 16px (default), 20px (comfortable), 24px (spacious). | All cards in a dashboard use 16px internal padding. All modals use 24px internal padding. | One card has 16px padding, another has 18px, and a third has 22px -- all on the same page. |
| 2.3 | **Section spacing follows a predictable pattern.** Spacing between major page sections uses 24px (tight), 32px (default), 48px (loose), or 64px (page-level). The pattern is consistent across all pages of the same type. | List pages always use 24px between the header bar and the filter row, 16px between the filter row and the table, and 32px above the pagination. | The gap between the header and the table is 24px on the Leads page but 40px on the Contacts page with no rationale. |
| 2.4 | **No arbitrary spacing values.** A codebase search for `px-[`, `py-[`, `mt-[`, `mb-[`, `ml-[`, `mr-[`, `gap-[`, `p-[`, `m-[` returns zero results (excluding documented exceptions). | `grep -r "px-\[" src/` returns no matches. | `grep -r "px-\[" src/` returns 47 matches across 12 files. |
| 2.5 | **Touch targets are minimum 44x44px on mobile.** All buttons, links, icons, and interactive elements meet this minimum at viewport widths below 768px. Tap area can exceed visual bounds using padding. | A 20px icon button has `p-3` (12px padding on each side), producing a 44px touch target. | A 20px icon button has `p-1` (4px padding), producing a 28px touch target that is difficult to tap on mobile. |

## 3. Layout Patterns

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 3.1 | **App shell follows the standard structure:** fixed sidebar (collapsible) on the left, scrollable main content area in the center, and an optional contextual right panel. The sidebar does not scroll with the page. Main content scrolls independently. | Sidebar remains fixed at full viewport height. Scrolling only affects the main content region. Collapsing the sidebar frees horizontal space for the main area. | The entire page scrolls as one unit, causing the sidebar to scroll off-screen. Or the sidebar overlaps content on smaller screens without a collapse mechanism. |
| 3.2 | **Content max-width is constrained.** Main content area has a max-width of 1280px and is centered within the available space on wide screens. Full-bleed layouts (dashboards, tables) may extend wider but must be explicitly opted in. | On a 1920px-wide monitor, the content area is 1280px wide and centered, with balanced gutters. | On a 1920px monitor, body text stretches to 1800px, making lines too long to read comfortably. |
| 3.3 | **Consistent page structure.** Every list/index page follows: page header (title + primary action) then filters/search bar then content (table or cards) then pagination/footer. Detail pages follow: page header (title + breadcrumb) then content sections then related items or activity. | The Leads list page and the Invoices list page both follow the same structural template. Swapping data sources would not require layout changes. | The Leads page puts filters in a sidebar, the Invoices page puts filters above the table, and the Messages page uses a search bar in a completely different position. |
| 3.4 | **Responsive breakpoints are consistent.** Mobile: below 768px (single column, stacked nav). Tablet: 768px to 1024px (collapsed sidebar, adapted grid). Desktop: above 1024px (full layout). No component uses custom breakpoints outside this system. | Media queries and Tailwind breakpoints use only `sm` (640px), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px), `xl` (1280px), `2xl` (1536px). | A component uses `@media (min-width: 850px)` or Tailwind `min-[850px]:` -- a breakpoint that exists nowhere else in the app. |
| 3.5 | **Grid-based card layouts use consistent gaps.** Card grids use 16px or 24px gaps. All cards in a grid are the same height (or use masonry with a documented rationale). Column counts follow responsive rules: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3-4 on desktop. | A dashboard uses a 3-column grid with 24px gap at desktop, collapsing to 2 columns on tablet and 1 on mobile. | Cards are laid out with inconsistent gaps (some 16px, some 20px, some 32px) on the same page. |

---

## 4. Tables and Lists

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 4.1 | **Column headers are styled distinctly from row data.** Headers use uppercase (or small-caps) text, a smaller font size (12px or 13px), muted color (gray-500 or equivalent), and medium weight. Headers are not bold at body size. | Column headers read "LEAD NAME," "STATUS," "CREATED" in 12px uppercase gray-500 text. Row data is 14px regular in gray-900. | Column headers use the same 14px size, weight, and color as row data, making them indistinguishable. |
| 4.2 | **Rows have a hover state.** Hovering over a table row applies a subtle background change (e.g., gray-50 or purple-50). The transition is smooth (150ms). Hover does not shift layout or text. | Hovering a row changes its background to `bg-gray-50` with a 150ms transition. Row height and text position remain unchanged. | Rows have no hover state, or hovering causes a visible layout jump from a border or padding change. |
| 4.3 | **Sortable columns display a clear directional indicator.** An arrow icon (chevron or caret) appears next to the active sort column. Inactive sortable columns show a neutral indicator on hover. The current sort direction (ascending/descending) is unambiguous. | The "Created" column header shows a downward chevron. Clicking it toggles to an upward chevron. Other sortable headers show a subtle bi-directional icon on hover. | Sortable columns have no visual indicator. The user must click and observe data changes to determine if a column is sortable or which direction is active. |
| 4.4 | **Empty states are informative and actionable.** When a table or list has zero items, the empty state includes: a relevant illustration or icon, a short explanatory message, and a call-to-action button to create the first item. | An empty Leads table shows a contacts illustration, the text "No leads yet," a subline "Create your first lead to start tracking your pipeline," and a "Create Lead" button. | An empty table shows a blank white area, or just the text "No data." |
| 4.5 | **Pagination or infinite scroll includes a count indicator.** The user can see total item count, current range, and navigate between pages. For infinite scroll, a "Showing X of Y" indicator is visible. | Below the table: "Showing 1-25 of 342 leads" with Previous/Next buttons and page numbers. | The table ends abruptly with no indication of how many total items exist or how to see more. |
| 4.6 | **Row actions use a consistent pattern.** The single most common action (e.g., "View" or "Edit") is available by clicking the row. Secondary actions live in a three-dot overflow menu at the row's trailing edge. Destructive actions appear last in the menu, styled in red. Bulk selection reveals a floating action bar. | Clicking a lead row opens the lead detail. A three-dot menu at the right offers "Edit," "Duplicate," and "Delete" (red). Selecting multiple rows reveals a top bar with "Export" and "Delete" options. | Some rows have inline "Edit" and "Delete" buttons that shift layout, while other rows use a dropdown, and bulk actions are hidden in a page-level menu. |

---

## 5. Forms

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 5.1 | **Labels are positioned above inputs.** Every form field has a visible text label placed directly above the input. Labels are not inline (side-by-side), not floating (inside the input), and not omitted. Labels use medium weight (500) and are visually associated with their input via proximity and `for`/`id` pairing. | A "Company Name" label sits 4px above a text input. Clicking the label focuses the input. | A text input uses placeholder text as its only label. Or the label floats inside the input and disappears when the user types. |
| 5.2 | **Help text appears below the input in muted color.** Optional guidance text is placed between the input and any error message, using a smaller font size (12-13px) and muted color (gray-500). | Below an "Email" input: "We'll use this to send invoices to your client" in 12px gray-500. | Help text is placed above the input (competing with the label), or uses the same size and color as the label, creating visual confusion. |
| 5.3 | **Error messages are red, positioned below the input, and include an icon.** Validation errors appear in red (red-600) with a small alert/exclamation icon, directly below the input (or below help text if present). The input border also turns red. Errors appear immediately on blur or on submit, not on keystroke. | After tabbing away from an empty required field, a red-bordered input shows "Company name is required" in red-600 with a circular exclamation icon. | An error appears as a toast at the top of the page with no indication of which field caused it. Or the input shows no red border -- only the text below changes color. |
| 5.4 | **Required fields are clearly indicated.** Required fields show a red asterisk (*) after the label, or the word "required" in muted text. Optional fields may be marked "(optional)" when most fields are required. The approach is consistent across all forms. | Every required field label ends with a red asterisk: "Company Name *". All forms in the app follow this same convention. | Some forms use asterisks, others use "(required)" text, and others give no indication until the user submits and hits validation. |
| 5.5 | **Disabled state is visually distinct and cursor-correct.** Disabled inputs have reduced opacity (0.5-0.6), a `not-allowed` cursor, and cannot receive focus. The visual treatment is consistent across input types (text, select, checkbox, radio, button). | A grayed-out "Plan Type" select field shows 50% opacity, the cursor changes to `not-allowed` on hover, and Tab skips the field. | A disabled field looks identical to an enabled field but simply does not respond to clicks, leaving the user confused about whether it is interactive. |
| 5.6 | **Form sections use clear grouping.** Long forms are divided into labeled sections with visible headings (or fieldset/legend). Sections are separated by 32-48px of vertical space or a subtle divider. Related fields are grouped together. | A "Create Client" form has sections: "Basic Information" (name, email, phone), "Address" (street, city, state, zip), and "Billing" (payment terms, tax ID). Each section has a heading and 32px of separation. | A 15-field form is a single undivided column with no grouping. The user cannot scan for a specific section. |
| 5.7 | **Submit button uses primary style and shows a loading state.** The submit button is the primary action (filled purple). On click, it enters a loading state: the label changes or a spinner replaces/accompanies it, and the button is disabled to prevent double submission. | Clicking "Create Lead" changes the button to a spinner with "Creating..." text. The button is disabled. On success, the user is redirected or a confirmation appears. | Clicking "Submit" does nothing visible for 2 seconds while the request processes. The user clicks again, creating a duplicate. |
| 5.8 | **Success confirmation appears after submit.** After a successful form submission, the user sees clear confirmation: a toast notification stating what was done, a redirect to the newly created resource, or an inline success message. The confirmation is specific, not generic. | After creating a lead: a toast reads "Lead 'Acme Corp' created successfully" and the user is redirected to the lead detail page. | After submitting a form, the page silently redirects with no feedback, or a generic "Success" toast appears with no specifics. |

---

## 6. Interaction States

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 6.1 | **All interactive elements implement 5 states:** Default, Hover, Focus, Active (pressed), and Disabled. No interactive element exists with fewer than these five visual states defined. | A button has: default (purple-600 fill), hover (purple-700 fill), focus (purple-600 fill + 2px purple-300 ring), active (purple-800 fill, slight scale-down), disabled (purple-300 fill, 50% opacity, not-allowed cursor). | A button changes color on hover but has no visible focus state, making keyboard navigation invisible. |
| 6.2 | **Focus rings are visible and consistent.** All focusable elements show a 2px ring with a 2px offset in purple-500 (or purple-400 on dark backgrounds). Focus rings appear only on keyboard navigation (`:focus-visible`), not on mouse click. | Tabbing through a form shows a purple focus ring on each input, button, and link. The ring is consistently 2px with 2px offset. Clicking a button does not show the ring. | Focus rings are the browser default (inconsistent blue), or focus rings are suppressed entirely via `outline: none` with no replacement. |
| 6.3 | **Loading states use skeletons or spinners, never blank screens.** Any content that loads asynchronously shows a skeleton placeholder (matching the expected layout shape) or a centered spinner. The page is never blank or frozen during loading. | Navigating to the Leads page immediately shows a skeleton table with pulsing gray rows that match the expected column layout. Data replaces the skeleton within 1-2 seconds. | Navigating to the Leads page shows a blank white area for 1.5 seconds before the table appears. |
| 6.4 | **Success states use green and are briefly visible.** Success feedback uses green-600 color, a check icon, and a specific message. Toasts auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds. Inline success messages persist until the user navigates away. | A toast with a green check appears: "Invoice #1042 sent to client@example.com." It dismisses after 4 seconds. | A success toast says "Done!" in gray with no icon, no specifics, and no auto-dismiss. |
| 6.5 | **Error states use red at both field and form levels.** Field-level errors appear below individual inputs with red border and message. Form-level errors (server errors, network failures) appear as a red alert banner at the top of the form. Both types are present when applicable. | A form shows red borders on two invalid fields with specific messages below each, plus a red banner at the top: "Please fix 2 errors below before submitting." | A form submission fails silently with no visible error, or errors appear only in the browser console. |
| 6.6 | **Transition durations follow the standard timing.** Color and opacity changes: 150ms. Transforms (scale, translate): 200ms. Layout shifts (expand/collapse, accordion): 300ms. Page-level transitions: 300-500ms. Easing functions: `ease-out` for entrances, `ease-in` for exits, `ease-in-out` for state changes. | A dropdown menu fades in over 150ms with ease-out and fades out over 150ms with ease-in. An accordion expands over 300ms with ease-in-out. | A dropdown takes 600ms to appear (feels sluggish). Or a hover color change is instant (0ms), feeling jarring. |

---

## 7. Accessibility

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 7.1 | **Text color contrast meets WCAG AA.** Normal text (below 18px or below 14px bold): minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background. Large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold): minimum 3:1 contrast ratio. Verify with a contrast checker tool. | Body text is gray-900 (#111827) on white (#FFFFFF) = 15.4:1 ratio. Muted text is gray-500 (#6B7280) on white = 5.9:1 ratio. Both pass AA. | Placeholder text is gray-300 (#D1D5DB) on white = 1.8:1 ratio. Muted help text is gray-400 on gray-50 = 3.2:1 ratio. Both fail AA for normal-sized text. |
| 7.2 | **Focus is visible on every interactive element.** Tabbing through the entire page reveals a visible focus indicator on every link, button, input, select, checkbox, radio, and custom interactive component. No element is skipped or invisible when focused. | Pressing Tab from the top of the page highlights: skip-to-content link, logo, each nav item, each form field, each button, in logical order. Every element shows the purple focus ring. | Tabbing skips over a dropdown trigger, a custom toggle, or an icon button -- the user cannot tell where focus is. |
| 7.3 | **Keyboard navigation is fully functional.** Tab moves forward through interactive elements, Shift+Tab moves backward. Enter activates buttons and links. Escape closes modals, dropdowns, and popovers. Arrow keys navigate within menus, tabs, and radio groups. | Pressing Escape on an open modal closes it and returns focus to the element that triggered it. Arrow keys cycle through dropdown menu items. | A modal can only be closed by clicking the X button. Pressing Escape does nothing. Or a dropdown requires mouse interaction to select an item. |
| 7.4 | **Icon-only buttons have accessible labels.** Every button or link that contains only an icon (no visible text) has an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute describing its function. Screen readers announce the purpose, not "button" or the icon's file name. | A trash-can icon button has `aria-label="Delete lead"`. A screen reader announces "Delete lead, button." | A trash-can icon button has no aria-label. A screen reader announces "button" with no indication of its purpose. |
| 7.5 | **A skip-to-content link is present.** The first focusable element on every page is a visually hidden "Skip to main content" link that becomes visible on focus and jumps to the main content area (`#main-content` or `<main>`). | Pressing Tab once on any page reveals a "Skip to main content" link at the top. Pressing Enter moves focus to the main content area, bypassing all navigation. | No skip link exists. Keyboard users must Tab through the entire sidebar and header to reach page content. |
| 7.6 | **Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers.** Toasts, loading states, form errors, and content updates use `aria-live` regions (polite for non-urgent, assertive for errors). Content injected into the DOM is announced without requiring the user to navigate to it. | A toast notification container has `aria-live="polite"`. When a toast appears, screen readers announce "Lead created successfully" without the user moving focus. | A toast appears visually but screen reader users have no idea it occurred because the container lacks `aria-live`. |
| 7.7 | **Information is not conveyed by color alone.** Every use of color to communicate status, state, or meaning is accompanied by a secondary indicator: text label, icon, pattern, or shape. Users who cannot perceive color can still understand the information. | A status badge shows a red dot AND the word "Overdue." A form error uses a red border AND a text message AND an exclamation icon. | A table cell turns green to indicate "paid" with no text label. A user who cannot distinguish green from gray has no way to determine the status. |

---

## 8. Motion Principles

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 8.1 | **Every animation serves a purpose.** Animations must guide attention (draw the eye to a new element), show relationships (connect a trigger to its result), or confirm actions (acknowledge user input). Decorative animation is not permitted. | A sidebar menu item slides its sub-menu into view, showing the spatial relationship between parent and child. A button press causes a brief scale-down confirming the tap. | A dashboard card continuously pulses or bounces to draw attention for no functional reason. Background elements drift or float purely for visual flair. |
| 8.2 | **Micro-interaction durations are 150-300ms.** Button state changes, hover effects, toggles, and small-element transitions complete within 150-300ms. They feel responsive without being abrupt. | A toggle switch slides from off to on in 200ms. A dropdown menu fades in over 150ms. | A toggle switch takes 800ms to animate (feels laggy and unresponsive). |
| 8.3 | **Page transitions are 300-500ms.** Route changes, full-page modals, and panel entrances/exits use 300-500ms durations. Content fades or slides in a single natural direction. | Navigating from the Leads list to a Lead detail slides the content in from the right over 300ms. Navigating back slides it out to the right. | A page transition takes 1 second with an elaborate zoom effect. Or there is no transition and the page swaps instantly with a flash of unstyled content. |
| 8.4 | **Easing functions match the motion type.** Entrances use `ease-out` (fast start, gentle stop -- the element arrives and settles). Exits use `ease-in` (gentle start, fast end -- the element accelerates away). State changes use `ease-in-out` (smooth throughout). Linear easing is not used for UI motion. | A modal entrance uses `ease-out`, giving it a natural deceleration as it reaches its final position. The modal exit uses `ease-in`, accelerating off-screen. | All animations use `linear` easing, making motion feel mechanical and robotic. Or entrances use `ease-in`, which makes elements appear to hesitate before arriving. |
| 8.5 | **`prefers-reduced-motion` is respected.** When the user's OS is set to "Reduce motion," all non-essential animations are disabled or replaced with instant state changes. Essential transitions (layout shifts that would cause disorientation without animation) may use a reduced 150ms crossfade. | With reduced motion enabled, the sidebar collapse snaps instantly instead of sliding. Toasts appear without a slide-in animation. A crossfade is used for page transitions. | With reduced motion enabled, all animations still play at full duration. The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is not referenced anywhere in the codebase. |
| 8.6 | **No animation on initial page load.** When a page first renders, all content appears immediately in its final position. Staggered entrance animations, hero animations, and scroll-triggered reveals are not used on the initial load. Subsequent user-initiated interactions may animate. | Opening the Leads page renders the header, filters, and table skeleton in their final positions instantly. Data populates the skeleton without entrance animation. | Opening the dashboard triggers a cascading entrance animation where each card fades in one by one over 2 seconds before the page is usable. |

---

## 9. Trust and Clarity

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 9.1 | **Destructive actions require a confirmation dialog.** Deleting records, removing team members, canceling subscriptions, and other irreversible actions present a confirmation modal. The modal states the consequence, identifies the specific item, and requires an explicit confirmation (not just "OK"). The destructive button is styled in red. | Clicking "Delete" on a lead shows a modal: "Delete 'Acme Corp'? This lead and all associated notes will be permanently removed. This cannot be undone." with a red "Delete Lead" button and a "Cancel" button. | Clicking "Delete" immediately removes the record with no confirmation. Or the confirmation says "Are you sure?" with no specifics about what will be deleted. |
| 9.2 | **Audit trail is visible for important actions.** Records that involve financial data, client communication, or status changes display a visible activity log showing who performed the action, when, and what changed. The log is accessible from the record's detail page. | A lead detail page shows an activity feed: "Jane Smith changed status from 'New' to 'Qualified' -- Feb 24, 2026 at 2:15 PM." The feed is chronological and scrollable. | A lead's status changes with no visible record of who changed it or when. The team cannot reconstruct the history of a record. |
| 9.3 | **Status indicators include text labels, not just color.** Every status badge, indicator dot, or state marker includes a readable text label alongside or instead of color. The text label alone is sufficient to understand the status. | A lead status badge shows a green dot AND the text "Active." An invoice badge shows a yellow dot AND the text "Pending." | A table column shows colored dots (green, yellow, red) with no text labels. Users must hover or memorize the color code. |
| 9.4 | **Monetary values are formatted with currency symbol and 2 decimal places.** All financial figures display a currency symbol ($ or relevant locale symbol), exactly two decimal places, and thousands separators. Negative values use a minus sign or parentheses, not red color alone. | Invoice total: "$12,450.00". Credit: "($500.00)" or "-$500.00". Even whole-dollar amounts show two decimals: "$1,000.00". | An invoice displays "12450" with no currency symbol, no decimals, and no thousands separator. Or a credit shows as "$500" in red with no negative indicator. |
| 9.5 | **Timestamps use relative format for recent and absolute for older.** Timestamps less than 24 hours old display as relative ("2m ago," "3h ago"). Timestamps older than 24 hours display as absolute ("Feb 24, 2026" or "Feb 24, 2026 at 2:15 PM"). The threshold and format are consistent across all pages. | An activity feed shows: "2m ago" for a recent update, "Yesterday at 4:30 PM" for yesterday, and "Feb 22, 2026" for two days ago. Hovering on any timestamp reveals the full absolute date and time. | All timestamps show absolute format ("2026-02-24T14:15:00Z") with no human-friendly formatting. Or relative timestamps say "0 days ago" instead of "Today." |
| 9.6 | **Permission-gated UI hides or disables unavailable actions.** Actions the current user lacks permission to perform are either hidden entirely (preferred when the user has no reason to know the action exists) or disabled with a tooltip explaining why. Actions are never shown as clickable only to produce a permission error on click. | A team member without "delete" permission sees no "Delete" button on the lead detail page. Or the button is visible but grayed out with a tooltip: "You don't have permission to delete leads. Contact your admin." | A team member clicks "Delete," and a red error toast appears: "Error 403: You do not have permission to perform this action." The user wasted effort and trust was eroded. |

---

## 10. Content and Copy

| # | Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|---|-----------|------|------|
| 10.1 | **Action labels are verb-first.** Button labels, menu items, and CTAs begin with an action verb and specify the object: "Create Lead," "Send Invoice," "Export CSV," "Archive Conversation." Labels are specific and unambiguous. | A modal footer button reads "Create Lead." A toolbar button reads "Export as CSV." A menu item reads "Duplicate Invoice." | A modal footer button reads "Submit." A toolbar button reads "Export." A menu item reads "Lead" (noun only, no verb). |
| 10.2 | **Error messages explain what happened and how to fix it.** Every error message has two parts: a description of the problem and a clear remediation step. Technical jargon, error codes, and stack traces are never shown to the user. | Field error: "Email address is invalid. Please enter a valid email like name@example.com." Server error banner: "We couldn't save your changes because the server is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes." | Field error: "Invalid input." Server error: "Error 500: Internal Server Error." Or: "Something went wrong." |
| 10.3 | **Empty states explain what will appear and how to get started.** Every empty list, table, dashboard widget, or content area has a purposeful empty state with three elements: an illustration or icon, a descriptive message explaining what the section is for, and a primary CTA to create the first item. | Empty invoices page: [invoice illustration] "No invoices yet." "Create and send professional invoices to get paid faster." [Create Invoice] button. | Empty invoices page: a blank white area. Or: "No data to display." |
| 10.4 | **Confirmation messages state what was done, not just "Success."** After any create, update, or delete action, the confirmation message names the specific item and action that occurred. Generic messages like "Success" or "Done" are not permitted. | Toast: "Lead 'Acme Corp' created successfully." Toast: "Invoice #1042 sent to billing@acme.com." Toast: "3 leads archived." | Toast: "Success!" Toast: "Operation completed." Toast: "Done." |
| 10.5 | **Non-obvious icons and abbreviated labels have tooltips.** Any icon-only button, abbreviated column header, or condensed label that might be ambiguous has a tooltip (on hover/focus) explaining its meaning. Tooltips appear after a 300-500ms delay and disappear on mouse leave. | An icon-only "filter" button shows a tooltip: "Filter leads" after 400ms hover delay. A column header "MRR" shows a tooltip: "Monthly Recurring Revenue." | An icon-only button with a gear icon has no tooltip. Users must click it to discover it opens settings. An abbreviated label "LTV" is never explained. |
| 10.6 | **Terminology is consistent across the entire application.** Each business concept uses exactly one term everywhere in the UI: navigation, headings, buttons, toasts, empty states, and documentation. A glossary of canonical terms is maintained and enforced. | The app consistently uses "Lead" for prospective contacts, "Client" for paying customers, and "Invoice" for billing documents. The sidebar, page titles, buttons, toasts, and empty states all use these same terms. | The sidebar says "Contacts," the page title says "Leads," the button says "Add Customer," and the toast says "Prospect created." The user encounters four different words for the same concept. |

## How to Use This Rubric

**During design review:** Walk through each category for the screen under review. Flag any criterion that does not pass. Treat Accessibility (Section 7) failures as blockers.

**During code review:** Verify spacing values, transition durations, aria attributes, and state coverage against the specific values in this rubric. Automated linting (e.g., Tailwind arbitrary value detection, axe-core accessibility checks) should catch many of these programmatically.

**During QA:** Test each interactive element for all 5 states (Section 6.1). Test all forms with empty, invalid, and valid inputs (Section 5). Test with keyboard only (Section 7.3). Test with a screen reader (Section 7.6). Test with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled (Section 8.5).

**Severity levels:**
- **Blocker:** Accessibility failures (Section 7), broken interaction states, missing error handling.
- **Critical:** Inconsistent spacing, missing loading states, ambiguous destructive actions.
- **Major:** Inconsistent copy/terminology, missing tooltips, animation timing issues.
- **Minor:** Suboptimal empty states, tooltip delay variations, minor spacing inconsistencies.
