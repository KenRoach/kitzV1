“The FMVA® was incredibly valuable during the Goldman Sachs interview process.”
I had it open on my second screen while working through the case study, which required building a model and presenting strategic alternatives. When I interviewed at Goldman Sachs, two of the three interviewers were familiar with the FMVA® and spoke highly of it. I felt the program was very comprehensive, I aced all my interviews thanks to the knowledge and skills I gained. I always recommend the FMVA® to colleagues looking to transition into investment banking or corporate finance.

We have the privilege of meeting with thousands of entrepreneurs every year, and in the course of those discussions are presented with all kinds of numbers, measures, and metrics that illustrate the promise and health of a particular company. Sometimes, however, the metrics may not be the best gauge of what’s actually happening in the business, or people may use different definitions of the same metric in a way that makes it hard to understand the health of the business.
So, while some of this may be obvious to many of you who live and breathe these metrics all day long, we compiled a list of the most common or confusing ones. Where appropriate, we tried to add some notes on why investors focus on those metrics. Ultimately, though, good metrics
aren’t
about
raising money
from VCs—they’re about running the business in a way where founders know how and why certain things are working (or not) … and can address or adjust accordingly.
Business and financial metrics
1. Bookings vs. revenue
A common mistake is to use bookings and revenue interchangeably, but they aren’t the same thing.
Bookings
is the value of a contract between the company and the customer. It reflects a contractual obligation on the part of the customer to pay the company.
Revenue
is recognized when the service is actually provided or ratably over the life of the subscription agreement. How and when revenue is recognized is governed by GAAP.
Letters of intent and verbal agreements are neither revenue nor bookings.
2. Recurring revenue vs. Total revenue
Investors more highly value companies where the majority of total revenue comes from product revenue (vs. from services). Why? Services revenue is non-recurring, has much lower margins, and is less scalable. Product revenue is the what you generate from the sale of the software or product itself.
ARR (annual recurring revenue)
is a measure of revenue components that are recurring in nature. It should exclude one-time (non-recurring) fees and professional service fees.
ARR per customer:
Is this flat or growing? If you are upselling or cross-selling your customers, then it should be growing, which is a positive indicator for a healthy business.
MRR (monthly recurring revenue):
