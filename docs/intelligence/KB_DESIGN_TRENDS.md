## 2025-2026 Design Trends

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Minimalism with personality** — clean, functional designs that still have character
- **Neumorphism** — soft, raised elements with subtle shadows
- **Glassmorphism** — frosted glass effects with blur and transparency
- **Dark mode** — essential, not optional — reduces eye strain, saves battery on OLED
- **Micro-interactions** — button pulses, sliding menus, loading animations that guide users
- **3D elements** — subtle 3D illustrations and icons for depth
- **Asymmetrical layouts** — breaking grid for visual interest
- **Motion design systems** — consistent animation language across the app

### SaaS Dashboard Design (2026)
- Balance functionality with creativity — clean AND engaging
- Data visualization as a first-class citizen — charts, graphs, KPIs front and center
- Split-panel layouts (KITZ already uses this pattern)
- Progressive disclosure — show what's needed, hide complexity
- Card-based components for modular content
- Real-time updates with subtle animation cues
- 2,000+ SaaS dashboard designs on Dribbble for reference

### Mobile-First Patterns
- Bottom navigation bars (thumb-friendly)
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Pull-to-refresh for real-time data
- Floating action buttons (FABs) for primary actions
- Sheet-based modals (bottom sheets)
- Skeleton loading screens instead of spinners
