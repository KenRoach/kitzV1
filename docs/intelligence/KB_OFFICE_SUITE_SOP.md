## Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Small Business

### What is an SOP?
A Standard Operating Procedure is a documented set of step-by-step instructions for completing routine business tasks. SOPs ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across all team members.

### Why SMBs Need SOPs
- **Consistency** — Every customer gets the same experience
- **Training** — New hires can self-serve onboarding
- **Scalability** — Processes work without the founder being present
- **Compliance** — Documented processes satisfy auditors and regulators
- **Knowledge retention** — Critical procedures survive employee turnover
