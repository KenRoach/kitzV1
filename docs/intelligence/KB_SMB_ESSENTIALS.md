## Financial Management

### Cash Flow Management (The #1 SMB Killer)
- **Rule of thumb:** Keep 3-6 months of operating expenses in reserve
- **Invoice promptly** — Send invoices within 24 hours of delivery
- **Payment terms** — Net 15 or Net 30 (shorter = better cash flow)
- **Follow up** — Day 1 (confirmation), Day 7 (reminder), Day 14 (urgency), Day 30 (escalation)
- **Separate accounts** — Operating, savings, tax reserve

### Pricing Strategy
- **Cost-plus**: Calculate total costs + desired margin (e.g., cost × 1.5 for 50% margin)
- **Value-based**: Price based on customer perceived value, not your costs
- **Competitive**: Match or beat competitor pricing
- **Tiered**: Good/Better/Best options (most choose middle)
- **Psychology**: $19.99 vs $20, bundle pricing, anchor pricing
