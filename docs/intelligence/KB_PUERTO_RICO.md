## Tax

### SURI -- Hacienda PR
- **Priority:** Critical
- **ID:** PKB-494
- **URL:** https://suri.hacienda.pr.gov/
- **Why KITZ needs it:** Puerto Rico tax portal: IVU (11.5%), income tax, Act 60 incentives (4% corporate)

**Extracted Intelligence:**

SURI (Sistema Unificado de Rentas Internas) is Puerto Rico's digital tax administration portal (created 2016).

**IVU (Sales and Use Tax):** General rate 10.5% (6% state + 4.5% municipal). Filed electronically via SURI. Monthly or quarterly (smaller merchants). Note: batch file lists 11.5% but current rate is 10.5% state+municipal combined.

**Income Tax:** Annual return (Planilla) via Form 482.0. Deadline: April 15. Progressive rates for residents.

**Act 60 Changes (2025):**
- New Investor program recipients starting Jan 1, 2026: passive income tax raised from 0% to 4%.
- Current holders keep 0% rate.
- Those obtaining decree before end of 2025 not subject to 4%.

**KITZ Application:** SURI portal is central for all PR tax obligations. IVU filing deadlines must be tracked. Act 60 changes create urgency for prospective investors to apply before 2026.

## Registration

### Departamento de Estado PR
- **Priority:** High
- **ID:** PKB-495
- **URL:** https://www.estado.pr.gov/
- **Why KITZ needs it:** PR company registration: LLC/Corp, US jurisdiction with tax incentives

**Extracted Intelligence:**

Registration through Corporations Registry at Department of State. Secure unique business name, prepare articles of incorporation/organization + bylaws/operating agreements. Register with Treasury (Form SS-4PR, corporate docs, federal EIN). Must complete before beginning operations.

**LLC:** $150 annual fee to continue operating (no annual report required).
**Corp:** From 2025, no annual reports but $100+ yearly fee for good standing.

**US Jurisdiction Benefits:** US dollar as official currency, free capital movement. Puerto Rico is distinct tax jurisdiction for IRS purposes.

**KITZ Application:** Guide PR business setup (simpler than many LATAM countries). US jurisdiction + tax incentives = attractive for LATAM entrepreneurs. LLC structure most popular for small businesses.

## Incentives

### Act 60 -- Export Services & Individual Investors
- **Priority:** High
- **ID:** PKB-496
- **URL:** https://www.ddec.pr.gov/
- **Why KITZ needs it:** PR tax incentives: 4% corporate tax, 0% capital gains for qualifying individuals

**Extracted Intelligence:**

**Export Services (Chapter 3, formerly Act 20):**
- Services performed in PR for clients outside PR taxed at just 4%.
- 100% tax exemption on PR-sourced dividends.
- Qualifying: consulting, marketing, software development, financial services.

**Individual Investors (Chapter 2, formerly Act 22):**
- 100% exemption from PR income taxes on interest, dividends, certain capital gains.
- 2025 Change: new recipients after 2025 face 4% on passive income (was 0%).
- Current holders keep 0% rate.

**Program Details:**
- Validity extended through 2055.
- DDEC processes applications via Single Business Portal.
- IRS scrutiny increasing (2025 reports of audits and challenges).

**KITZ Application:** Major selling point for LATAM entrepreneurs considering PR. 4% corporate + 0% capital gains (for pre-2026 applicants) is highly competitive. Must warn about increasing IRS scrutiny. KITZ should help users evaluate if Act 60 fits their business model.
