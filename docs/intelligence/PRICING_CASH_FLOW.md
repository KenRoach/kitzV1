# Part 1: Pricing & Margin Strategies

## 1.1 Industry Margin Benchmarks

The following benchmarks synthesize data from industry reports, Damodaran datasets, and
LatAm-specific research. Margins in Latin America tend to be 2-5 percentage points lower
than US/EU equivalents due to higher input cost volatility, informal competition, and
currency risk. Where LatAm-specific figures are available they are noted; otherwise US/global
benchmarks are adjusted with a LatAm discount factor.

### Restaurants / Food Service

| Metric | Quick Service | Casual Dining | Fine Dining | Food Trucks / Street Food |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 60-70% | 55-65% | 60-70% | 65-75% |
| Net Profit Margin | 4-6% | 2-4% | 5-10% | 8-15% |
| Food Cost % | 28-35% | 30-38% | 28-35% | 25-32% |
| Labor Cost % | 25-30% | 30-35% | 30-40% | 15-25% |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- In Mexico, fondas and cocinas economicas operate on razor-thin net margins (2-5%) but
  benefit from extremely low rent in mercados and colonias populares.
- Brazilian rodizios and buffets per kilo achieve 5-8% net margins through high throughput.
- Street food vendors across LatAm often achieve the highest net margins (10-15%) due to
  minimal overhead, but with lower absolute revenue.
- Top-performing restaurants in the region report net margins near 10%, while the industry
  average hovers between 3-5%.

### Retail (Physical and E-Commerce)

| Metric | Clothing/Fashion | Grocery | Electronics | General Merchandise | E-commerce (Marketplace) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 50-60% | 25-35% | 15-25% | 40-50% | 30-45% |
| Net Profit Margin | 4-8% | 1-3% | 2-5% | 3-7% | 3-8% |
| Markup % | 100-150% | 15-30% | 20-40% | 50-100% | 40-80% |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- E-commerce sellers on Mercado Libre pay commissions of 11-17% per sale depending on
  category, which must be factored into margin calculations.
- Physical retail in LatAm faces intense competition from informal tianguis (Mexico),
  ferias (Brazil/Chile), and mercados populares, which operate with near-zero overhead.
- Grocery retail margins are notoriously thin (1-3% net) and dominated by large chains
  like Oxxo, Grupo Exito, Cencosud, and Carrefour Brasil.

### Professional Services (Accounting, Legal, Marketing)

| Metric | Accounting | Legal | Marketing/Digital Agency | General Consulting |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 50-70% | 55-75% | 45-65% | 50-70% |
| Net Profit Margin | 15-25% | 20-35% | 10-20% | 15-30% |
| Billable Utilization Target | 75-80% | 65-75% | 70-80% | 75-80% |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- Professional services in LatAm are growing rapidly, with Brazil and Mexico leading demand
  for accounting, legal, and consulting services driven by economic development and
  digital transformation.
- 2024 global benchmarks showed EBITDA fell to 9.8% (from 15.4% in 2023) as revenue growth
  slowed -- LatAm firms should target above-average utilization to compensate.
- Billable utilization in the region often falls below the 75% optimal threshold, creating a
  significant profit improvement opportunity.
- Consultant markups range from 150-200% on time costs; specialized experts command
  300-500%.

### Beauty / Wellness (Salons, Barbershops, Spas)

| Metric | Hair Salon | Barbershop | Spa/Wellness | Nail Salon |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 55-65% | 50-60% | 50-65% | 55-65% |
| Net Profit Margin | 5-12% | 8-15% | 8-15% | 6-12% |
| Service Revenue % | 80-90% | 85-95% | 70-85% | 75-85% |
| Product Revenue % | 10-20% | 5-15% | 15-30% | 15-25% |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- The average salon profit margin globally is approximately 8.2%, with a range of 2-17%.
- Barbershops in LatAm (especially Mexico and Colombia) have experienced a renaissance
  with "barber culture" driving higher prices and better margins (10-15% net).
- Chair rental models are common in Brazil and allow salon owners to reduce labor cost risk.
- Product upselling (professional haircare lines) can add 3-5% to net margins.

### Construction / Trades

| Metric | General Contracting | Plumbing | Electrical | HVAC/Refrigeration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 20-35% | 40-55% | 30-45% | 35-50% |
| Net Profit Margin | 5-10% | 8-20% | 6-14% | 8-15% |
| Material Markup | 20-35% | 25-50% | 25-40% | 25-45% |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- Plumbing service calls yield the highest margins (40-55%) because material costs are low
  relative to labor -- a $12 valve requires 30 minutes of skilled installation.
- Specialty contractors (electricians, HVAC) often achieve 15-25% net margins.
- Construction in LatAm is highly seasonal, with government infrastructure spending
  creating boom-bust patterns.
- Informal competition is fierce -- licensed contractors must differentiate on quality
  and warranty to justify premium pricing.

### Health / Medical Services

| Metric | General Medical Clinic | Dental Practice | Optometry | Veterinary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 55-70% | 60-75% | 55-70% | 55-65% |
| Net Profit Margin | 10-20% | 20-40% | 15-25% | 10-18% |
| Lab/Material Cost % | 10-20% | 15-25% | 20-35% | 15-25% |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- Dental practices achieve strong margins (30-40% net for general dentistry; 40-60% for
  orthodontics) making dentistry one of the highest-margin SMB categories.
- Medical tourism in Mexico and Colombia (dental, cosmetic surgery) allows pricing 40-60%
  below US rates while maintaining strong local margins.
- The private healthcare sector in LatAm continues to grow as public systems face capacity
  constraints.

### Education / Tutoring

| Metric | In-Person Tutoring Center | Online Tutoring | Language School | Vocational Training |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 55-70% | 75-90% | 50-65% | 45-60% |
| Net Profit Margin | 10-20% | 20-50% | 8-15% | 10-18% |
| Student Acquisition Cost | High | Medium | Medium | Low-Medium |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- The LatAm online tutoring market is expected to reach US$1.87 billion by 2030, growing
  at 16.4% CAGR -- a major opportunity for Kitz users.
- Solo online tutors achieve 40-60% operating margins; franchised centers average 10-20%.
- Back-to-school season (Feb/Mar in Southern Cone, Aug/Sep in Mexico) drives major
  enrollment spikes.
- English language tutoring commands premium pricing across LatAm.

### Technology / SaaS

| Metric | Early-Stage SaaS | Growth SaaS | IT Services | Tech Consulting |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross Margin | 70-85% | 75-90% | 35-50% | 50-70% |
| Net Profit Margin | -20% to 5% | 10-25% | 8-15% | 15-25% |
| Target LTV:CAC | 3:1+ | 3:1+ | 2:1+ | 2:1+ |

**LatAm-specific notes:**
- SaaS pricing in LatAm must account for purchasing power parity (PPP); products often
  price 40-60% below US equivalents.
- Freemium models are essential for adoption in price-sensitive LatAm markets.
- Mercado Libre's fintech arm (Mercado Pago) and Nubank demonstrate that LatAm tech can
  achieve massive scale -- Nubank showed $4.2B in Q3 2025 originations (up 40% YoY).

## 1.2 Pricing Strategies Playbook

### Strategy 1: Cost-Plus Pricing

**When to use:** Products with well-defined input costs (food, retail goods, manufacturing).
Best for businesses new to pricing or in highly commoditized markets.

**Formula:**

```
Selling Price = Total Cost x (1 + Markup Percentage)
```

**TypeScript implementation for Kitz AI agents:**

```typescript
interface CostPlusInput {
  directMaterialCost: number;
  directLaborCost: number;
  overheadAllocation: number;
  targetMarkupPercent: number;
}

function calculateCostPlusPrice(input: CostPlusInput): {
  totalCost: number;
  sellingPrice: number;
  grossMargin: number;
  grossMarginPercent: number;
} {
  const totalCost =
    input.directMaterialCost +
    input.directLaborCost +
    input.overheadAllocation;

  const sellingPrice = totalCost * (1 + input.targetMarkupPercent / 100);
  const grossMargin = sellingPrice - totalCost;
  const grossMarginPercent = (grossMargin / sellingPrice) * 100;

  return {
    totalCost: Math.round(totalCost * 100) / 100,
    sellingPrice: Math.round(sellingPrice * 100) / 100,
    grossMargin: Math.round(grossMargin * 100) / 100,
    grossMarginPercent: Math.round(grossMarginPercent * 10) / 10,
  };
}

// Example: A restaurant dish in Mexico City
const tacoPlatter = calculateCostPlusPrice({
  directMaterialCost: 45, // MXN - ingredients
  directLaborCost: 15,    // MXN - prep time allocation
  overheadAllocation: 10,  // MXN - rent, utilities, etc.
  targetMarkupPercent: 200, // 200% markup = ~33% food cost ratio
});
// Result: sellingPrice = 210 MXN, grossMarginPercent = 66.7%
```

**Recommended markup percentages by industry:**

| Industry | Low Markup | Standard Markup | Premium Markup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Restaurant food | 150% | 200-250% | 300%+ |
| Restaurant beverages | 300% | 400% | 500%+ |
| Retail clothing | 80% | 100-120% | 150%+ |
| Retail grocery | 15% | 25-30% | 40% |
| Electronics retail | 20% | 30-40% | 50% |
| Professional services | 100% | 150-200% | 300%+ |
| Beauty services | 150% | 200% | 300%+ |
| Construction/trades | 20% | 30-50% | 60%+ |

### Strategy 2: Value-Based Pricing

**When to use:** Services with high perceived value, specialized expertise, or outcomes-based
work (consulting, medical, design, legal). Ideal for differentiated businesses.

**How to determine perceived value:**

1. **Customer research** -- Survey target market to gauge willingness to pay. Ask open-ended
   questions about what outcomes matter most and what they would pay for those outcomes.
2. **Segment identification** -- Different segments have different price thresholds, enabling
   differential pricing (e.g., corporate clients vs. individuals).
3. **Unique value analysis** -- Identify what extra value you deliver that competitors do not.
4. **Outcome quantification** -- For B2B services, quantify the ROI your service delivers.

```typescript
interface ValueBasedPricingInput {
  costToDeliver: number;
  competitorPrice: number;
  perceivedValueMultiplier: number; // 1.0 = parity, 1.5 = 50% more value
  customerSegment: 'budget' | 'standard' | 'premium';
}

const segmentDiscounts: Record<string, number> = {
  budget: 0.7,    // Price at 70% of perceived value
  standard: 0.85, // Price at 85% of perceived value
  premium: 1.0,   // Price at 100% of perceived value
};

function calculateValueBasedPrice(input: ValueBasedPricingInput): {
  recommendedPrice: number;
  floorPrice: number;
  ceilingPrice: number;
  valueToCustomer: number;
} {
  const valueToCustomer = input.competitorPrice * input.perceivedValueMultiplier;
  const segmentFactor = segmentDiscounts[input.customerSegment];
  const recommendedPrice = valueToCustomer * segmentFactor;
  const floorPrice = input.costToDeliver * 1.3; // Minimum 30% margin
  const ceilingPrice = valueToCustomer; // Never exceed perceived value

  return {
    recommendedPrice: Math.max(floorPrice, Math.round(recommendedPrice * 100) / 100),
    floorPrice: Math.round(floorPrice * 100) / 100,
    ceilingPrice: Math.round(ceilingPrice * 100) / 100,
    valueToCustomer: Math.round(valueToCustomer * 100) / 100,
  };
}

// Example: A marketing agency in Bogota, Colombia
const brandingPackage = calculateValueBasedPrice({
  costToDeliver: 2_000_000,        // COP - labor + tools
  competitorPrice: 5_000_000,      // COP - average competitor price
  perceivedValueMultiplier: 1.4,   // 40% more value via better portfolio
  customerSegment: 'standard',
});
// Result: recommendedPrice ~5,950,000 COP
```

### Strategy 3: Competitive Pricing

**How to research competitors in LatAm:**

1. **Mystery shopping** -- Visit competitor locations or websites; note prices for identical
   or similar services.
2. **Mercado Libre / Amazon Mexico** -- For products, search your category and sort by
   best-selling to see dominant price points.
3. **Google Maps reviews** -- Customers sometimes mention prices in reviews.
4. **WhatsApp/social media inquiry** -- In LatAm, many businesses quote prices via WhatsApp;
   send inquiries as a prospective customer.
5. **Industry associations** -- CANACO (Mexico), FENALCO (Colombia), SEBRAE (Brazil) publish
   sector pricing benchmarks.

```typescript
interface CompetitorPriceData {
  competitorName: string;
  price: number;
  qualityScore: number; // 1-10
  marketShare: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
}

function calculateCompetitivePrice(
  competitors: CompetitorPriceData[],
  ownQualityScore: number,
  strategy: 'penetration' | 'parity' | 'premium'
): { recommendedPrice: number; rationale: string } {
  const avgPrice =
    competitors.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.price, 0) / competitors.length;
  const avgQuality =
    competitors.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.qualityScore, 0) / competitors.length;

  const qualityDifferential = ownQualityScore / avgQuality;

  const strategyMultipliers = {
    penetration: 0.85,  // 15% below market
    parity: 1.0,        // Match market
    premium: 1.15,      // 15% above market
  };

  const basePrice = avgPrice * qualityDifferential;
  const recommendedPrice = basePrice * strategyMultipliers[strategy];

  const rationale =
    `Market average: ${avgPrice.toFixed(2)}. ` +
    `Quality differential: ${(qualityDifferential * 100 - 100).toFixed(1)}%. ` +
    `Strategy: ${strategy}. ` +
    `Recommended: ${recommendedPrice.toFixed(2)}.`;

  return {
    recommendedPrice: Math.round(recommendedPrice * 100) / 100,
    rationale,
  };
}
```

### Strategy 4: Psychological Pricing

**Key tactics proven effective in LatAm markets:**

1. **Charm Pricing (precios terminados en 9)** -- Prices ending in .99 or .90 exploit
   the left-digit bias. Research in Brazilian e-commerce confirms this drives impulse
   purchases, especially among middle and lower-income segments. Example: $199.90 MXN
   instead of $200 MXN.

2. **Anchoring (anclaje de precios)** -- Display original price alongside the discounted
   price. LatAm consumers in particular respond strongly to visible "antes/ahora"
   (before/now) comparisons. Brazilian e-commerce platforms frequently use this tactic.

3. **Bundle Pricing (paquetes)** -- Combine services or products at a perceived discount.
   Example: "Corte + barba + cejas = $250 MXN" vs. individual prices totaling $320 MXN.

4. **Decoy Pricing (precio senuelo)** -- Offer three tiers where the middle option provides
   the best perceived value. The expensive option makes the middle look reasonable.

5. **"Meses sin intereses" (Interest-free installments)** -- Extremely powerful in LatAm
   where credit access is limited. Even for services, offering "3 meses sin intereses"
   dramatically increases conversion.

6. **Multiple Purchase Discounts (3x2, 2x1)** -- The "3 por 2" promotion is deeply
   embedded in LatAm retail culture, commonly used to clear perishables or introduce new
   products.

```typescript
interface PsychologicalPricingOptions {
  basePrice: number;
  currency: 'MXN' | 'BRL' | 'COP' | 'ARS' | 'PEN' | 'CLP';
}

function applyCharmPricing(options: PsychologicalPricingOptions): number {
  const { basePrice, currency } = options;

  // Different charm endings by currency convention
  const charmEndings: Record<string, number> = {
    MXN: 0.90,  // Mexico: $199.90
    BRL: 0.99,  // Brazil: R$199.99
    COP: 900,   // Colombia: $199,900 COP (prices are in thousands)
    ARS: 0.99,  // Argentina: $199.99
    PEN: 0.90,  // Peru: S/199.90
    CLP: 0,     // Chile: prices are whole numbers, end in 990
  };

  if (currency === 'COP') {
    // Colombian prices operate in thousands
    return Math.floor(basePrice / 1000) * 1000 + charmEndings[currency];
  }
  if (currency === 'CLP') {
    // Chilean prices end in 990
    return Math.floor(basePrice / 1000) * 1000 + 990;
  }

  return Math.floor(basePrice) + charmEndings[currency];
}

function generateAnchoredPrice(
  currentPrice: number,
  anchorMultiplier: number = 1.4
): { anchorPrice: number; displayPrice: number; savingsPercent: number } {
  const anchorPrice = Math.round(currentPrice * anchorMultiplier);
  const savingsPercent = Math.round(
    ((anchorPrice - currentPrice) / anchorPrice) * 100
  );
  return {
    anchorPrice,
    displayPrice: currentPrice,
    savingsPercent,
  };
}

function generateBundlePrice(
  items: { name: string; individualPrice: number }[],
  discountPercent: number = 15
): {
  individualTotal: number;
  bundlePrice: number;
  savings: number;
  itemNames: string[];
} {
  const individualTotal = items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.individualPrice, 0);
  const bundlePrice = Math.round(
    individualTotal * (1 - discountPercent / 100)
  );
  return {
    individualTotal,
    bundlePrice,
    savings: individualTotal - bundlePrice,
    itemNames: items.map((i) => i.name),
  };
}

// Example: Barbershop in Medellin
const barberBundle = generateBundlePrice([
  { name: 'Corte clasico', individualPrice: 25_000 },
  { name: 'Perfilado de barba', individualPrice: 15_000 },
  { name: 'Diseno de cejas', individualPrice: 10_000 },
], 20);
// Result: Bundle = 40,000 COP vs. 50,000 COP individual (20% savings)
```

### Strategy 5: Dynamic Pricing

**When to use:** Tourism, hospitality, events, perishable goods, ride-sharing,
delivery services.

**Seasonal adjustments for LatAm:**

| Season/Event | Country | Price Adjustment | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Carnival | Brazil | +30-50% (tourism services) | 1 week (Feb/Mar) |
| Buen Fin | Mexico | -10-30% (promotional) | 4 days (November) |
| Christmas/Navidad | All LatAm | +10-20% (gifts/food) | Dec 1-24 |
| Semana Santa | All LatAm | +20-40% (tourism) | 1 week (Mar/Apr) |
| Back-to-School | Varies | +5-15% (education/supplies) | 2-4 weeks |
| Low tourism season | Caribbean/Mexico | -15-30% | May-October |

```typescript
interface DynamicPricingInput {
  basePrice: number;
  currentDemandIndex: number;   // 0.0-2.0, where 1.0 = normal
  inventoryLevel: number;       // 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 = full
  dayOfWeek: number;            // 0=Sun, 6=Sat
  isHolidaySeason: boolean;
  competitorPriceIndex: number; // 0.5-1.5, where 1.0 = at parity
}

function calculateDynamicPrice(input: DynamicPricingInput): {
  adjustedPrice: number;
  priceChange: number;
  factors: string[];
} {
  let multiplier = 1.0;
  const factors: string[] = [];

  // Demand adjustment (max +/- 30%)
  const demandFactor = 1 + (input.currentDemandIndex - 1) * 0.3;
  multiplier *= demandFactor;
  if (demandFactor !== 1) {
    factors.push(`Demand: ${demandFactor > 1 ? '+' : ''}${((demandFactor - 1) * 100).toFixed(0)}%`);
  }

  // Inventory scarcity (low stock = higher price, max +20%)
  if (input.inventoryLevel < 0.3) {
    const scarcityFactor = 1 + (0.3 - input.inventoryLevel) * 0.67;
    multiplier *= scarcityFactor;
    factors.push(`Low stock: +${((scarcityFactor - 1) * 100).toFixed(0)}%`);
  }

  // Weekend premium (Fri-Sun, +5-10%)
  if (input.dayOfWeek >= 5 || input.dayOfWeek === 0) {
    multiplier *= 1.07;
    factors.push('Weekend: +7%');
  }

  // Holiday season
  if (input.isHolidaySeason) {
    multiplier *= 1.15;
    factors.push('Holiday season: +15%');
  }

  // Competitive response (dampen extreme deviations)
  if (input.competitorPriceIndex < 0.9) {
    multiplier *= 0.95;
    factors.push('Competitor undercut: -5%');
  }

  // Cap maximum adjustment at +/- 50%
  multiplier = Math.max(0.5, Math.min(1.5, multiplier));

  const adjustedPrice = Math.round(input.basePrice * multiplier * 100) / 100;
  const priceChange = Math.round((multiplier - 1) * 100 * 10) / 10;

  return { adjustedPrice, priceChange, factors };
}
```

### Strategy 6: Freemium / Tiered Pricing

**When to use:** Service businesses, SaaS, education, consulting. Particularly effective
in LatAm where customers want to "try before they buy" and trust must be established.

**Tiered pricing template:**

```typescript
interface PricingTier {
  name: string;
  monthlyPrice: number;
  features: string[];
  targetSegment: string;
  isPopular: boolean;
}

function generateTieredPricing(
  baseCostPerUser: number,
  currency: string
): PricingTier[] {
  return [
    {
      name: 'Gratis',
      monthlyPrice: 0,
      features: [
        'Funciones basicas',
        'Hasta 50 clientes',
        'Soporte por email',
      ],
      targetSegment: 'Emprendedores iniciando',
      isPopular: false,
    },
    {
      name: 'Profesional',
      monthlyPrice: Math.round(baseCostPerUser * 3),
      features: [
        'Todas las funciones basicas',
        'Hasta 500 clientes',
        'Reportes avanzados',
        'Soporte por WhatsApp',
        'Integraciones',
      ],
      targetSegment: 'PyMEs en crecimiento',
      isPopular: true, // Decoy effect: highlight this as "Mas Popular"
    },
    {
      name: 'Empresarial',
      monthlyPrice: Math.round(baseCostPerUser * 7),
      features: [
        'Todas las funciones profesionales',
        'Clientes ilimitados',
        'API access',
        'Soporte prioritario 24/7',
        'Gerente de cuenta dedicado',
        'Personalizacion',
      ],
      targetSegment: 'Empresas establecidas',
      isPopular: false,
    },
  ];
}
```

## 1.3 Price Elasticity in LatAm

### Overview

Latin American consumers are among the most price-sensitive in the world due to:

- **Persistent inflation** averaging ~6% annually across the region, with extremes in
  Argentina (100%+) and Venezuela.
- **Purchasing power erosion** -- household purchasing power in LatAm fell approximately
  25% due to inflation in recent years. Consumers responded by buying smaller portions
  and switching to cheaper alternatives (private labels, generics).
- **Cash-dependent economies** -- a significant portion of transactions remain cash-based,
  limiting dynamic pricing adoption in some sectors.
- **Strong value-seeking culture** -- the "buscar ofertas" (bargain-hunting) mindset is
  deeply embedded. Consumers actively compare prices across channels.

### Elasticity by Segment

| Segment | Elasticity | Behavior | Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic necessities (food, hygiene) | Low (-0.3 to -0.6) | Must buy regardless | Small price increases absorbed |
| Discretionary (clothing, electronics) | High (-1.2 to -2.0) | Defer or substitute | Price increases cause volume loss |
| Services (beauty, dining out) | Medium (-0.7 to -1.2) | Trade down, reduce frequency | Offer value tiers |
| Premium/luxury | Low (-0.3 to -0.8) | Status-driven | Less price-sensitive segment |
| Subscription/recurring | Medium (-0.8 to -1.3) | Evaluate alternatives at renewal | Lock in annual contracts |

### Country-Specific Price Sensitivity

| Country | Sensitivity Level | Key Driver | Pricing Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Argentina | Extreme | Hyperinflation, currency instability | Price in USD or adjust monthly; offer smaller packages |
| Venezuela | Extreme | Economic crisis | Dollar pricing essential |
| Mexico | High | Inflation, competition from informal market | Charm pricing + installments effective |
| Brazil | High | Income inequality, inflation history | Parcelamento (installments) is table stakes |
| Colombia | Medium-High | Growing middle class but inflation concerns | Value bundles, prima seasons important |
| Chile | Medium | Most stable economy in region | Standard pricing strategies work |
| Peru | Medium-High | Informal economy competition | Competitive pricing essential |

### Strategies for Price-Sensitive Markets

1. **Smaller package sizes** -- "sachets strategy" (selling shampoo in single-use packets)
   is widespread in LatAm. Apply this principle to services: offer 30-min sessions, single
   treatments, trial classes.
2. **Installment payments ("meses sin intereses")** -- In Brazil, "parcelamento" is so
   standard that not offering it is a competitive disadvantage. In Mexico, "6 MSI" (6
   months without interest) on credit card is extremely common.
3. **Everyday Low Price (EDLP)** -- The Walmart/Bodega Aurrera model is widely imitated.
   Stable, transparent pricing builds trust.
4. **3x2 and 2x1 promotions** -- The most recognizable promotional format in LatAm retail.
   Use for clearing perishables, introducing new products, or driving trial.

```typescript

  currentPrice: number;

  proposedPriceChange: number; // percentage (e.g., 10 for 10% increase)

  } else if (revenueChange > -2) {
    recommendation =
      'NEUTRAL: Impacto minimo en ingresos. Considere si el margen mejora.';
  } else {
    recommendation =
      'PRECAUCION: El aumento de precio reducira los ingresos. Considere alternativas.';
  }

  return {
    newPrice: Math.round(newPrice * 100) / 100,
    expectedVolume,
    volumeChange: Math.round(volumeChangePercent * 10) / 10,
    currentRevenue: Math.round(currentRevenue),
    projectedRevenue: Math.round(projectedRevenue),
    revenueChange: Math.round(revenueChange * 10) / 10,
    recommendation,
  };
}

// Example: A salon in CDMX considering a 10% price increase
const salonAnalysis = predictVolumeImpact({
  currentPrice: 350,        // MXN per corte
  currentVolume: 400,       // cortes per month
  estimatedElasticity: -0.9, // moderately elastic
  proposedPriceChange: 10,   // 10% increase
});
// Result: Volume drops ~9%, but revenue increases ~0.1% -- marginal gain

## 1.5 When and How to Raise Prices

### Signs It Is Time to Raise Prices

1. **Your margins are shrinking** -- Costs have risen but prices have not.
2. **You are turning away business** -- Demand exceeds capacity.
3. **You have not raised prices in 12+ months** -- Inflation alone erodes margins.
4. **Competitor prices are higher** -- You may be undervaluing your offering.
5. **Customer acquisition is easy** -- Low resistance suggests you are priced too low.
6. **You have improved quality/service** -- Enhanced value justifies higher prices.
7. **Customer complaints about price are rare** -- If nobody ever objects, you are too cheap.

### Price Increase Methods

| Method | Description | Risk Level | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Across-the-board | Raise all prices equally (e.g., +8%) | Medium | Inflation adjustment |
| Selective | Raise prices on best sellers, keep loss leaders | Low | Retail, food |
| Grandfathering | New customers pay more, existing keep old price | Low | Services, subscriptions |
| New packaging | Repackage/rebrand at higher price point | Low | Products, services |
| Reduce discounts | Keep list price, stop offering discounts | Very Low | Businesses over-discounting |
| Add premium tier | Keep current prices, add expensive option | Very Low | All businesses |

# Part 2: Cash Flow Management

## 2.1 Cash Flow Patterns by Industry & Season

### Monthly Cash Flow Curves by Industry

Understanding typical cash flow patterns helps Kitz AI predict and prepare for lean periods.

**Restaurants / Food Service:**
- Relatively stable monthly patterns with predictable weekly cycles
- Weekends: 40-60% of weekly revenue
- Low periods: January (post-holiday austerity), September (back-to-school expenses)
- High periods: December (Christmas parties), Mother's Day, Valentine's Day

**Retail:**
- Highly seasonal with massive December spike
- Cash flow challenge: Must invest in inventory 30-60 days before peak season
- Buen Fin (Mexico) can represent 15-30% of annual revenue in just 4 days
- Post-holiday January is typically the weakest month

**Professional Services:**
- Collections lag: Revenue recognized when work is done, cash received 30-60 days later
- Year-end spike: Tax season drives accounting revenue Jan-Apr
- Corporate budget cycles create Q4 spending rushes
- Summer slowdown (Jun-Aug in Northern Hemisphere, Dec-Feb in Southern)

**Beauty / Wellness:**
- Weekly cycle: Thursday-Saturday are peak days (70% of weekly revenue)
- December is strongest month (holiday parties, events)
- January/February often weakest (post-holiday budget tightening)
- Quinceañeras and wedding season (Apr-Jun in Mexico) drive spikes

**Construction / Trades:**
- Highly project-dependent with lumpy cash flows
- Payment delays of 30-90 days are standard
- Rainy season creates seasonal downturns
- Government payment delays can be 60-120+ days

### Country-Specific Seasonal Patterns

#### Mexico

| Period | Event | Impact | Industries Affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| January-February | Cuesta de enero (post-holiday austerity) | -20-30% consumer spending | All retail, services |
| February 14 | Dia del Amor y la Amistad | +30-50% | Restaurants, flowers, gifts |
| March-April | Semana Santa | +20-40% tourism | Hotels, restaurants, transport |
| May 10 | Dia de las Madres | +40-60% | Restaurants (biggest day), gifts, beauty |
| August-September | Regreso a clases | +15-25% | Education, retail (uniforms, supplies) |
| October 31-Nov 2 | Dia de Muertos | +15-30% tourism | Tourism, food, crafts, flowers |
| November 15-18 | Buen Fin | +15-30% annual sales in 4 days | All retail, e-commerce |
| December | Navidad + Aguinaldo | +40-60% | All industries |

**Mexico Aguinaldo effect:** By law, employers must pay workers a minimum of 15 days salary
before December 20. This massive cash injection drives the December retail boom.

**Buen Fin data (2025):** El Buen Fin 2025 reached MX$219 billion (US$12 billion), a 26.6%
increase over the prior year. 89% of MSMEs reported an average sales increase of 15.5%,
representing 15-30% of their annual revenues.

#### Brazil

| Period | Event | Impact | Industries Affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| January-February | Post-holiday + summer vacation | Mixed: tourism up, B2B down | Tourism +, services - |
| February-March | Carnival | +30-50% tourism, -20% B2B (country stops) | Tourism, food, beverage, entertainment |
| March-April | Semana Santa | +10-20% | Food, tourism |
| May (2nd Sunday) | Dia das Maes | +25-40% | Retail, restaurants, beauty |
| June | Festas Juninas | +15-25% regional | Food, crafts, events (especially Northeast) |
| August (2nd Sunday) | Dia dos Pais | +15-25% | Retail, electronics |
| September 7 | Independencia | Moderate | Tourism, events |
| October 12 | Dia das Criancas | +20-30% | Toys, children's retail, entertainment |
| November (4th Friday) | Black Friday | +20-40% | E-commerce, retail |
| December | Natal + 13o salario | +40-60% | All industries |

**Brazil Carnival data (2026):** Over 65 million participants, US$3.6 billion economic
impact. Bars and restaurants generated R$5.4 billion (~US$935M), transportation R$3.31
billion (~US$573M). International visitors: 300,000 (up 17% YoY).

**Brazil 13th salary (decimo terceiro):** By law, employers pay one extra monthly salary
in two installments: 50% by November 30 and 50% by December 20. This funds the
Christmas shopping boom.

#### Colombia

| Period | Event | Impact | Industries Affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| January | Rebajas de enero | -10-15% (post-holiday) | Retail |
| March-April | Semana Santa | +15-25% | Tourism, food |
| May (Mother's Day) | Dia de la Madre | +25-35% | Restaurants, gifts, beauty |
| June | Prima de servicios (1st half) | +20-30% consumer spending | All retail, services |
| June-July | Vacaciones escolares | +15-20% | Tourism, entertainment |
| October | Dia de los Ninos / Halloween | +10-15% | Children's retail, costumes |
| November | Black Friday (adopted) | +15-25% | E-commerce, retail |
| December | Prima de servicios (2nd half) + Navidad | +40-60% | All industries |

**Colombia Prima de servicios:** Under Law 50 of 1990, employers must pay a mandatory
bonus equal to one month's salary in two installments: 50% by June 30 and 50% by
December 20. These dates create the two biggest spending peaks of the year.

#### Argentina

| Period | Event | Impact | Industries Affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| January-February | Verano + vacaciones | +20-30% tourism, -15% B2B | Tourism, hospitality |
| March | Regreso a clases | +15-20% | Education, retail |
| March-April | Semana Santa | +15-25% | Tourism, food |
| June | Aguinaldo (SAC 1st half) | +20-30% | Retail, consumer goods |
| July | Vacaciones de invierno | +15-20% | Tourism, entertainment |
| November | Black Friday (adopted) | +15-25% | E-commerce, retail |
| December | Aguinaldo (SAC 2nd half) + Navidad | +40-60% | All industries |

**Argentina Aguinaldo (SAC):** The Sueldo Anual Complementario is paid in two halves: by
June 30 and December 18. Each installment is 50% of the highest monthly wage in the
prior six months. In a high-inflation economy, these payments provide critical demand
spikes. Retail categories like automobiles, appliances, clothing, and furniture see the
largest boosts.

#### Tourism-Dependent Economies

| Country/Region | High Season | Low Season | Revenue Differential |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mexican Caribbean (Cancun, Riviera Maya) | Nov-Apr | May-Oct (hurricane season) | 2-3x |
| Pacific Mexico (Puerto Vallarta, Cabo) | Nov-May | Jun-Oct | 1.5-2.5x |
| Costa Rica | Dec-Apr (dry season) | May-Nov (rainy season) | 1.5-2x |
| Peru (Cusco/Machu Picchu) | May-Sep (dry season) | Nov-Mar (rainy season) | 2-3x |
| Brazilian Northeast beaches | Dec-Mar | Apr-Nov | 1.5-2x |
| Patagonia (Argentina/Chile) | Nov-Mar (austral summer) | Apr-Oct | 3-5x |
| Caribbean islands | Dec-Apr | Jun-Nov (hurricane season) | 2-3x |

### DSO Benchmarks by Country (LatAm)

Based on the Coface 2025 Latin America Corporate Payment Survey:

| Country | Average Payment Terms | Average Payment Delay | Effective DSO (Terms + Delay) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brazil | 66 days | ~40 days | ~106 days |
| Peru | 60 days | ~35 days | ~95 days |
| Argentina | 55 days | 26-27 days | ~82 days |
| Chile | 55 days | 26-27 days | ~82 days |
| Colombia | 50 days | ~35 days | ~85 days |
| Ecuador | 55 days | 70 days | ~125 days |
| **LatAm Average** | **59 days** | **42 days** | **~101 days** |

**Critical insight:** 77% of companies in LatAm reported late payments (up from 51% in
2024). The average delay is 42 days -- meaning if you offer Net 30, expect to actually
receive payment around Day 72 on average.

### Inventory Turnover Benchmarks by Industry

| Industry | Target Turns/Year | Good | Excellent | Critical Action Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Restaurant (perishables) | 20-30 | 15-20 | 30+ | Below 12 |
| Fast food | 25-40 | 20-25 | 40+ | Below 15 |

### Cash Conversion Cycle Optimization Strategies

**The Three Levers:**

1. **Reduce DSO (collect faster)**
   - Offer early payment discounts (2/10 Net 30)
   - Send invoices immediately upon delivery
   - Use WhatsApp reminders (see Collections section)
   - Accept digital payments (reduce check processing time)
   - Require deposits for large orders (30-50% upfront)

2. **Reduce DIO (sell inventory faster)**
   - Implement ABC analysis: focus resources on high-value A-items
   - Adopt just-in-time ordering where possible
   - Set automated reorder points based on sales velocity
   - Run clearance promotions for slow-moving stock
   - Negotiate smaller, more frequent deliveries with suppliers

3. **Increase DPO (pay suppliers later, ethically)**
   - Negotiate 45-60 day terms with key suppliers
   - Use supplier credit lines strategically
   - Pay on the due date, not before (unless there is a discount)
   - Consolidate purchases for better negotiation leverage
   - Time payments to coincide with your cash inflow peaks

```typescript
function modelCCCImprovement(
  current: { dso: number; dio: number; dpo: number },
  improvements: { dsoDelta: number; dioDelta: number; dpoDelta: number },
  dailyRevenue: number
): {
  currentCCC: number;
  improvedCCC: number;
  cashFreed: number;
  annualizedBenefit: number;
} {
  const currentCCC = current.dso + current.dio - current.dpo;
  const improvedCCC =
    (current.dso - improvements.dsoDelta) +
    (current.dio - improvements.dioDelta) -
    (current.dpo + improvements.dpoDelta);

  const daysFreed = currentCCC - improvedCCC;
  const cashFreed = daysFreed * dailyRevenue;

  return {
    currentCCC,
    improvedCCC,
    cashFreed: Math.round(cashFreed),
    annualizedBenefit: Math.round(cashFreed * 0.15), // Assume 15% cost of capital
  };
}

// Example: A retail store in Medellin, Colombia
const cccImprovement = modelCCCImprovement(
  { dso: 45, dio: 60, dpo: 30 },           // Current: CCC = 75 days
  { dsoDelta: 10, dioDelta: 15, dpoDelta: 10 }, // Improvements
  { dailyRevenue: 500_000 } as any,         // COP 500K/day
);
// Would free: (75 - 40) * 500,000 = COP 17,500,000 in working capital
```

## 2.3 Collections Best Practices for LatAm

### Payment Terms by Country Norms

| Country | Standard B2B Terms | Common in Practice | SMB-to-Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mexico | Net 30 | Net 30-45 | Cash/card at time of service |
| Brazil | Net 30-45 | Net 45-60 (boleto bancario) | Parcelamento (2-12x) |
| Colombia | Net 30 | Net 30-45 | Cash/transfer at time of service |
| Argentina | Net 15-30 | Net 30 (adjusted for inflation) | Cash/transfer |
| Chile | Net 30 | Net 30-45 | Cash/card/transfer |
| Peru | Net 30 | Net 30-60 | Cash at time of service |

### WhatsApp Collections Workflow

WhatsApp has 90%+ penetration in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina, making it the
most effective collections channel in LatAm. Companies implementing structured WhatsApp
collection strategies report 60-80% improvements in recovery rates compared to phone
calls or emails.

**Legal requirements:**
- Maintain documented opt-in authorization for collections communication
- Only contact between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM on weekdays (additional weekend restrictions)
- Maintain professional, respectful tone (no threats, intimidation, or insults)
- Keep records of all communications
- Use WhatsApp-approved Template Messages for business-initiated contact

### Automated Collections Timeline

```
Day -3:  Pre-due reminder (friendly)
Day 0:   Invoice due date
Day 1:   Payment confirmation or first overdue notice
Day 3:   WhatsApp reminder #1 (friendly)
Day 7:   WhatsApp reminder #2 (firm but respectful)
Day 14:  Phone call + WhatsApp follow-up
Day 21:  WhatsApp reminder #3 (formal notice of overdue status)
Day 30:  Formal written notice (carta de cobro)
Day 45:  Final notice before escalation
Day 60:  Collection agency / legal consultation
Day 90+: Legal action
```

### Early Payment Discounts

**2/10 Net 30 Explained:**
Offer a 2% discount if the customer pays within 10 days; otherwise full payment is due
in 30 days.

**Financial impact:** Offering 2% to accelerate payment by 20 days translates to an
annualized financing cost of approximately 36%. This is only worthwhile if:
- Your cost of capital exceeds 36% (common in LatAm with high interest rates)
- Cash flow timing is critical (e.g., you need to pay suppliers or make payroll)
- The customer has a history of very late payment

**LatAm variations:**

| Discount Structure | Typical Use | Effective Annual Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 2/10 Net 30 | Standard | ~36% |
| 3/10 Net 45 | B2B Colombia/Brazil | ~31% |
| 5/10 Net 60 | Large invoices, LatAm B2B | ~36% |
| 1/5 Net 30 | Small amounts, retain more margin | ~15% |
| 10% upfront deposit | Service businesses | Reduces risk, improves cash flow |

```typescript
function evaluateEarlyPaymentDiscount(
  invoiceAmount: number,
  discountPercent: number,
  discountDays: number,
  netDays: number,
  costOfCapitalAnnual: number // e.g., 0.25 for 25%
): {
  discountAmount: number;
  effectiveAnnualRate: number;
  isWorthOffering: boolean;
  recommendation: string;
} {
  const discountAmount = invoiceAmount * (discountPercent / 100);
  const daysSaved = netDays - discountDays;
  const effectiveAnnualRate =
    (discountPercent / (100 - discountPercent)) * (365 / daysSaved) * 100;

  const isWorthOffering = effectiveAnnualRate < costOfCapitalAnnual * 100;

  let recommendation: string;
  if (isWorthOffering) {
    recommendation =
      `SI ofrecer: El costo del descuento (${effectiveAnnualRate.toFixed(1)}% anualizado) ` +
      `es menor que su costo de capital (${(costOfCapitalAnnual * 100).toFixed(1)}%).`;
  } else {
    recommendation =
      `NO recomendado: El costo del descuento (${effectiveAnnualRate.toFixed(1)}% anualizado) ` +
      `excede su costo de capital (${(costOfCapitalAnnual * 100).toFixed(1)}%). ` +
      `Mejor usar una linea de credito.`;
  }

  return {
    discountAmount: Math.round(discountAmount * 100) / 100,
    effectiveAnnualRate: Math.round(effectiveAnnualRate * 10) / 10,
    isWorthOffering,
    recommendation,
  };
}
```

### Late Payment Penalties by Country

**Mexico:**
- Commercial Code Article 362: Default interest at the contractually agreed rate; in
  its absence, 6% per annum.
- Federal Civil Code Article 2395: Legal interest is 9% per annum.
- In practice, maximum moratory interest is approximately 2.5% monthly on the owed amount.
- Conventional interest can be higher if agreed between parties, but disproportionate
  rates can be challenged by the debtor.

**Brazil:**
- Civil Code Article 406: Legal default interest linked to SELIC rate (currently ~13.25%).
- Consumer relationships: maximum of 1% monthly moratory interest plus monetary correction.
- Commercial relationships: parties may agree on higher rates, but subject to judicial review.

**Colombia:**
- Maximum legal interest rate set by the Superintendencia Financiera, updated quarterly.
- Usury rate (interes de usura): typically 1.5x the banking current interest rate.
- Late payments may accrue interest at the maximum legal rate unless contractually lower.

**Argentina:**
- Due to hyperinflation, interest rates are extremely high and frequently adjusted.
- Commercial default interest often contractually linked to the Banco Nacion passive rate
  or similar benchmark.
- Courts may adjust excessive contractual interest rates.

**General LatAm best practice:** Always specify late payment interest in your contracts
and invoices. In the absence of explicit terms, legal default rates apply, which are
often lower than market rates.

## 2.4 Cash Flow Forecasting

### 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast

The 13-week (one quarter) rolling forecast is the gold standard for SMB cash management.
It provides enough granularity for weekly decision-making while covering a full business
quarter.

**Key principles:**
- Update weekly with actual data
- Always start from actual bank balance (not accounting balance)
- Forecast collections based on historical patterns, not invoice dates
- Include all cash movements, not just operating items
- Maintain three scenarios: pessimistic, likely, and optimistic

### Kitz AI Prompt for Cash Flow Analysis

When Kitz AI analyzes a business's cash flow, it should follow this structured approach:

```typescript
const CASH_FLOW_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
Analiza el flujo de efectivo del negocio con los siguientes pasos:

1. DIAGNOSTICO ACTUAL
   - Saldo actual en banco vs. obligaciones de las proximas 2 semanas
   - Tendencia de los ultimos 3 meses: mejorando, estable, o deteriorandose
   - Relacion ingresos/egresos de los ultimos 30 dias

2. IDENTIFICAR RIESGOS
   - Pagos grandes proximos (nomina, renta, impuestos, prestamos)
   - Clientes con pagos vencidos (monto y dias de atraso)
   - Inventario estancado que amarra capital

3. OPORTUNIDADES DE MEJORA
   - Cobros pendientes que se pueden acelerar
   - Gastos que se pueden diferir sin afectar operacion
   - Proveedores con quienes se puede negociar mejores terminos

4. RECOMENDACIONES PRIORIZADAS
   - Acciones inmediatas (esta semana)
   - Acciones de corto plazo (proximo mes)
   - Cambios estructurales (proximo trimestre)

5. PROYECCION 13 SEMANAS
   - Escenario pesimista, probable y optimista
   - Semanas criticas donde el flujo puede ser negativo
   - Reserva de emergencia recomendada
`;
```

### Scenario Planning Framework

| Scenario | Revenue Assumption | Cost Assumption | Collection Assumption | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pessimistic | -20% from baseline | +5% from baseline | +14 days delay | Stress testing, crisis planning |
| Likely | Baseline (historical avg) | Baseline | Historical pattern | Day-to-day management |
| Optimistic | +15% from baseline | -3% from baseline | -7 days (faster) | Growth planning, investment decisions |
| Crisis | -40% from baseline | +10% from baseline | +30 days delay | Emergency planning (pandemic, recession) |

## 2.5 Emergency Cash Flow Strategies

### Factoring / Invoice Discounting in LatAm

Invoice factoring allows businesses to sell their accounts receivable to a third party
(factor) at a discount in exchange for immediate cash.

**LatAm factoring market:** Projected to exceed USD $60 billion by 2030. MSMEs make up
99.5% of businesses in LatAm and are the primary beneficiaries.

**Key platforms and providers by country:**

| Country | Key Players | Typical Advance Rate | Typical Fee |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mexico | E Factor Network, Konfio, Credijusto | 80-90% | 1.5-4% per month |
| Brazil | Nexoos, BizCapital, QI Tech | 75-90% | 1.5-5% per month |
| Colombia | Mesfix, Portal Finance, Sempli | 80-90% | 2-4% per month |
| Chile | Buda.com, Cumplo, Banca Me | 80-90% | 1.5-3% per month |
| Peru | Facturedo, Innova Factoring | 75-85% | 2-5% per month |
| Pan-LatAm | Mercado Libre (Mercado Credito) | Varies | Integrated into platform |

**Regulatory landscape:**
- Mexico: Fintech Law (2018) regulates financial technology institutions
- Brazil: Resolution No. 4,991 (2022) allows fintechs to offer receivables financing
- Colombia: Decree 1154 (2020) regulates electronic trading of invoices; DIAN's RADIAN
  system monitors factoring transactions digitally
- Colombia's Financial Superintendency operates a regulatory sandbox for fintech

**When to use factoring:**
- You have creditworthy customers but they pay slowly (Net 60+)
- You need cash to fund growth or seasonal inventory purchases
- Your cost of factoring is less than the cost of missing opportunities
- You cannot access or do not qualify for traditional bank credit

```typescript
interface FactoringAnalysis {
  invoiceAmount: number;
  daysUntilPayment: number;
  factoringFeePercent: number; // monthly
  advanceRatePercent: number;
  alternativeCostOfCapital: number; // annual %
}

function evaluateFactoring(input: FactoringAnalysis): {
  advanceAmount: number;
  factoringCost: number;
  effectiveAnnualRate: number;
  netReceived: number;
  recommendation: string;
} {
  const advanceAmount = input.invoiceAmount * (input.advanceRatePercent / 100);
  const months = input.daysUntilPayment / 30;
  const factoringCost = advanceAmount * (input.factoringFeePercent / 100) * months;
  const netReceived = advanceAmount - factoringCost;
  const effectiveAnnualRate = (input.factoringFeePercent * 12);

  let recommendation: string;
  if (effectiveAnnualRate < input.alternativeCostOfCapital) {
    recommendation =
      `Factoring RECOMENDADO: Tasa efectiva (${effectiveAnnualRate.toFixed(1)}%) ` +
      `es menor que su costo alternativo de capital (${input.alternativeCostOfCapital}%).`;
  } else {
    recommendation =
      `Factoring NO recomendado como primera opcion: Tasa efectiva (${effectiveAnnualRate.toFixed(1)}%) ` +
      `excede su costo alternativo. Considerar solo si no tiene otras opciones de financiamiento.`;
  }

  return {
    advanceAmount: Math.round(advanceAmount),
    factoringCost: Math.round(factoringCost),
    effectiveAnnualRate: Math.round(effectiveAnnualRate * 10) / 10,
    netReceived: Math.round(netReceived),
    recommendation,
  };
}
```

### Lines of Credit by Country

| Country | Major Providers | Typical Range (USD equiv.) | Annual Rate Range | Collateral Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mexico | Konfio, Credijusto, Banorte PyME | $1K-$100K | 18-45% | Varies (often unsecured for small amounts) |
| Brazil | Nubank, Banco Inter, BNDES (subsidized) | $500-$200K | 15-60% (SELIC-linked) | Varies |
| Colombia | Bancolombia PyME, Sempli, Bold | $500-$50K | 20-40% | Often unsecured |
| Argentina | BICE, Nacion PyME (subsidized lines) | $500-$50K | Highly variable (inflation-linked) | Government-backed programs available |
| Chile | BancoEstado, CORFO-backed, Banca Me | $1K-$100K | 8-25% | CORFO guarantees available |

**Fintech lending growth:** Nubank reported total originations of $4.2 billion for
Q3 2025 (up 40% YoY). MercadoLibre's merchant loans reached $1.9 billion (up 60.7% YoY).
These integrated lending products are increasingly how LatAm SMBs access working capital.

### Cost-Cutting Hierarchy

When cash is tight, cut costs in this order (least impactful to operations first):

```
Priority 1 - IMMEDIATE (No operational impact)
  - Cancel unused subscriptions and software
  - Renegotiate insurance, internet, phone plans
  - Eliminate non-essential travel and entertainment
  - Pause marketing experiments (keep proven channels)

Priority 2 - SHORT-TERM (Minor operational impact)
  - Reduce inventory orders to minimum viable levels
  - Defer non-essential maintenance (not safety-related)
  - Negotiate payment deferrals with flexible suppliers
  - Switch from monthly to per-use services where possible
  - Sublease unused office/warehouse space

Priority 3 - MEDIUM-TERM (Moderate operational impact)
  - Reduce working hours for non-essential staff
  - Renegotiate rent (LatAm landlords often prefer reduced rent over vacancy)
  - Consolidate supplier relationships for volume discounts
  - Convert fixed costs to variable where possible

Priority 4 - LAST RESORT (Significant operational impact)
  - Reduce headcount (furlough before layoff where legally possible)
  - Close underperforming locations or service lines
  - Sell non-essential equipment or assets
  - Seek debt restructuring with lenders

NEVER CUT:
  - Safety-related expenses
  - Legal/tax compliance costs
  - Core customer-facing quality
  - Key employee retention measures

      );
    }
    if (input.creditLineAvailable) {
      financingOptions.push(
        `Linea de credito disponible: $${input.creditLineLimit.toLocaleString()}. Usar solo lo necesario.`
      );
    }
  } else if (severityLevel === 'orange') {
    immediateActions.push('Acelerar cobros: enviar recordatorios WhatsApp a todos los clientes con saldo vencido.');
    immediateActions.push('Revisar gastos y eliminar no esenciales.');
    immediateActions.push('Preparar plan de contingencia si la situacion empeora.');
  } else if (severityLevel === 'yellow') {
    immediateActions.push('Monitorear flujo semanalmente.');
    immediateActions.push('Optimizar ciclo de cobros (reducir DSO).');
    immediateActions.push('Construir reserva de emergencia (meta: 3 meses de gastos).');
  }

  return {
    runwayWeeks,
    severityLevel,
    immediateActions,
    financingOptions,
  };
}

## Appendix C: Kitz AI Agent Integration Guide

### How Kitz AI Should Use This Intelligence

1. **New Business Onboarding:** When a new SMB joins Kitz, use the industry margin
   benchmarks to set initial pricing expectations and health metrics.

2. **Pricing Recommendations:** When an owner asks "How should I price this?", use the
   markup formulas with the appropriate industry multiplier and positioning level.

3. **Cash Flow Alerts:** Run the 13-week forecast weekly. Alert owners when any scenario
   shows negative cash within the next 4 weeks.

4. **Collections Automation:** Trigger WhatsApp collection messages automatically based on
   the collections timeline. Escalate through the message templates as days overdue increase.

5. **Seasonal Preparation:** 30 days before major seasonal events (by country), prompt
   owners to prepare: stock inventory, schedule staff, plan promotions.

6. **Price Increase Coaching:** When margins deteriorate below industry benchmarks for
   2+ consecutive months, suggest a price review using the price increase analysis tool.

7. **Emergency Response:** When cash runway drops below 4 weeks in any scenario, activate
   emergency protocols and present the cost-cutting hierarchy and revenue acceleration
   tactics.
