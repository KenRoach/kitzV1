PostHog data stack, built for data teams and loved by product teams
Built-in, Product OS ships with:
A data warehouse
120+ sources/destinations
SQL editor + BI + data viz
User activity feed (CDP-lite)
API, webhooks
When you're analyzing how customers use your product, you should be operating from
the full set of data
.
This includes customer information that happens
outside your product
:
payments from Stripe
exceptions in an error tracking tool
tickets in your support platform
Having all the data in one place means you can make more informed decisions about what to build next.
PostHog's Product OS isn't just analytics – it's the entire suite of tools built to give you a single source of truth about your customers.

All our paid products are pay-per-use with generous monthly free tiers. In fact, 98% of our customers use PostHog for free.
We aim to be the cheapest option at scale – PostHog should be a no-brainer. You never have to "jump on a quick call" with sales.

The open standard for telemetry
Learn More
Try the demo
OpenTelemetry
is an open source observability framework for cloud native
software. It provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector
services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application.
OpenTelemetry builds upon years of experience from the OpenTracing and
OpenCensus projects, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the
community.
Vendor-neutral instrumentation
Instrument your code once using OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs. Export telemetry
data to any observability backend—Jaeger, Prometheus, commercial vendors, or
your own solution. Switch backends without touching your application code.
Unified observability signals
Correlate traces, metrics, and logs with shared context that flows through your
entire request path. Get a complete picture of your application’s behavior
across all components and services.
Run anywhere
OpenTelemetry is 100% open source and vendor-neutral. Deploy on-premises, in
hybrid environments, or across multiple clouds with full flexibility and zero
lock-in. Move workloads wherever they matter to you.

Auto-instrumentation
Get started in minutes with zero-code instrumentation for popular frameworks and

without modifying your source code.
Collector pipeline
Process, filter, and route telemetry data with the OpenTelemetry Collector.
Deploy as an agent or gateway to receive, process, and export telemetry at scale
with 200+ components.
Context propagation
Automatically correlate traces across service boundaries. Distributed context
flows through your entire request path, connecting logs, metrics, and traces
into a unified view.
Multi-language support
Native SDKs for 12+ languages including Java, Kotlin, Python, Go, JavaScript,
.NET, Ruby, PHP, Rust, C++, Swift, and Erlang. Use your preferred language with
first-class OpenTelemetry support.
Stable and production-ready
Tracing and metrics APIs are stable across all major languages. Thousands of
organizations run OpenTelemetry in production. Backed by the CNCF and major
cloud providers.

Dimensional data model
Prometheus models time series in a flexible dimensional data model. Time series are identified by a metric name and a set of key-value pairs.
Powerful queries
The PromQL query language allows you to query, correlate, and transform your time series data in powerful ways for visualizations, alerts, and more.
Precise alerting
Alerting rules are based on PromQL and make full use of the dimensional data model. A separate Alertmanager component handles notifications and silencing.
Simple operation
Prometheus servers operate independently and only rely on local storage. Developed in Go, the statically linked binaries are easy to deploy across various environments.
Instrumentation libraries
Prometheus provides a large number of official and community-contributed metrics instrumentation libraries that cover most major languages.
Ubiquitous integrations
Prometheus comes with hundreds of official and community-contributed integrations that allow you to easily extract metrics from existing systems.
Modern monitoring
Monitoring for the cloud native world
Designed for the cloud native world, Prometheus integrates with Kubernetes and other cloud and container managers to continuously discover and monitor your services. It is the second project to graduate from the CNCF after Kubernetes.
Even though Borgmon remains internal to Google, the idea of treating time-series data as a data source for generating alerts is now accessible to everyone through those open source tools like Prometheus [...]
