**Fixed Mindset:** Believes qualities are unchangeable. Every situation is evaluation. Avoids challenges, gives up easily, threatened by others' success.

**Growth Mindset:** Believes qualities can be cultivated through effort. "The hand you're dealt is just the starting point." Passionate about learning. Embraces challenges, persists through obstacles, learns from criticism.

**KITZ Application:** KITZ should embody growth mindset in every interaction. Frame declining metrics as "not yet" rather than failure. Celebrate effort and learning, not just results.
