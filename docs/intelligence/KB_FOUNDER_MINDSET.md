How to Win Friends and Influence People
is a 1936
self-help
book written by
Dale Carnegie
. Over 30 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it one of
the best-selling books of all time
.
[

Carnegie had been conducting business education courses in New York since 1912.
[
3
]
In 1934,
Leon Shimkin
, of the publishing firm
Simon & Schuster
, took one of Carnegie's 14-week courses on human relations and public speaking, and later persuaded Carnegie to let a
stenographer
take notes from the course to be revised for publication.
[
3
]
The initial five thousand copies of the book sold exceptionally well, going through 17 editions in its first year alone.
[
3
]
In 1981, a revised edition containing updated language and anecdotes was released.
[
4
]
The revised edition reduced the number of sections from six to four, eliminating sections on effective
business letters
and improving marital satisfaction. In 2011, it was number 19 on
Time
'
s list of the 100 most influential Nonfiction books.
[

Origins
[
edit
]
Before
How to Win Friends and Influence People
was released, the genre of self-help books had an ample heritage.
[
citation needed
]
Authors such as
Orison Swett Marden
and
Samuel Smiles
had enormous success with their self-help books in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
[
citation needed
]
Dale Carnegie began his career teaching night classes at a
YMCA
in New York,
[
clarification needed
]
later expanding to YMCAs in Philadelphia and Baltimore.
[
6
]
He then taught independently at hotels in London, Paris, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore,
[
citation needed
]
writing small booklets to go along with his courses.
[
7
]
After one of his 14-week courses, he was approached by publisher
Leon Shimkin
of the publishing house
Simon & Schuster
.
[
8
]
Shimkin urged Carnegie to write a book, but he was not initially persuaded. Shimkin then hired a
stenographer
to type up what he heard in one of Carnegie's long lectures and presented the transcript to Carnegie,
[
9
]
who edited and revised it into a final form.
[
10
]
To market the book, Shimkin sent 500 copies of the book to former graduates of the Dale Carnegie Course, with a note that pointed out the utility of the book for refreshing students with the advice they had learned.
[
11
]
: 141
The 500 mailed copies brought orders for over 5,000 more copies of the book and Simon & Schuster had to increase the original print order of 1,200 quickly.

12 Core Principles from How to Win Friends and Influence People – David Cummings on Startups
12 Core Principles from How to Win Friends and Influence People
Written by
David Cummings
in
Community
After finishing the book
How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
, I now highly recommend it to entrepreneurs. The book has a tremendous number of short anecdotes and ideas about how to be a better person. In the latter part of the book the author enumerates 12 core principles to win people over for your way of thinking:
The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
Begin in a friendly way.
Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.
Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.
Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.
Appeal to the nobler motives.
Dramatize your ideas.
Throw down a challenge.
Entrepreneurs should put this book on their list and embrace the 12 core principles.
What else? What are your thoughts on the 12 core principles?

How to Stop Worrying and Start Living
is a
self-help
book by
Dale Carnegie
first printed in 1948. Carnegie says in the preface that he wrote it because he "was one of the unhappiest lads in New York". He said that he made himself sick with worry because he hated his position in life, which he credits for wanting to figure out how to stop worrying. The book's goal is to lead the reader to a more enjoyable and fulfilling life, helping them to become more aware of, not only themselves, but others around them. Carnegie tries to address the everyday nuances of living, in order to get the reader to focus on the more important aspects of life.
The book's title is satirically referenced in that of the film
Dr. Strangelove
.

Ray Dalio
In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Over forty years later, Bridgewater has grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to
Fortune
magazine, and Dalio himself has been named to
Time
magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.

Carol Dweck: A Summary of Growth and Fixed Mindsets
There are two main mindsets we can navigate life with: growth and fixed. Having a growth mindset is essential for success. In this post, we explore how to develop the right mindset for improving your intelligence.
***
Carol Dweck studies human motivation. She spends her days diving into why people succeed (or don’t) and what’s within our control to foster success. Her theory of the two mindsets and the difference they make in outcomes is incredibly powerful.
As she describes it: “My work bridges developmental psychology, social psychology, and personality psychology, and examines the self-conceptions (or mindsets) people use to structure the self and guide their behavior. My research looks at the origins of these mindsets, their role in motivation and self-regulation, and their impact on achievement and interpersonal processes.”
Her inquiry into our beliefs is synthesized in
Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
. The book takes us on a journey into how our conscious and unconscious thoughts affect us and how something as simple as wording can have a powerful impact on our ability to improve.
Dweck’s work shows the power of our most basic beliefs. Whether conscious or subconscious, they strongly “affect what we want and whether we succeed in getting it.” Much of what we think we understand of our personality comes from our “mindset.” This both propels us and prevents us from fulfilling our potential.
In
Mindset: The New Psychology of Success
, Dweck writes:
What are the consequences of thinking that your intelligence or personality is something you can develop, as opposed to something that is a fixed, deep-seated trait?
The Two Mindsets
Your view of yourself can determine everything. If you believe that your qualities are unchangeable — the fixed mindset — you will want to prove yourself correct over and over rather than learning from your mistakes.
In
Mindset
, Dweck writes:
If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character— well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.
[…]
I’ve seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves— in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?
These things are culturally desirable. We value intelligence, personality, and character. It’s normal to want this. But …

After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a
fixed mindset
— those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a
growth mindset
— those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.
In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love — to transform their lives and your own.

Mindset is the key to success
Intro
American psychologist Carol Dweck is primarily interested in the influence of mindset on motivation and self-regulation. She believes that the right mindset can be the key to our success. She specifically focuses on fixed and growth mindsets, which she believes are two ends of a spectrum of how people view their abilities. Those towards the fixed end believe their abilities are innate and unchangeable, whereas those who lie towards the growth end of the continuum believe that their abilities are malleable, and success can be achieved through hard work.
Dweck promotes a
growth mindset
as more adaptive than a
fixed mindset
and encourages parents and teachers to guide children in developing a growth mindset. Her ultimate goal is to reduce stress and encourage people to persevere when faced with challenges. Individuals with a fixed mindset tend to stay down when they fall. Dweck stresses the importance of getting back up and trying again, reminding us that, with dedication and hard work, we are all capable of achieving great things.
“
Test scores and measures of achievement tell you where a student is, but they don’t tell you where a student could end up.

The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses
is a 2011 book by American entrepreneur
Eric Ries
. It outlines the
lean startup
methodology, a framework for startup development that prioritizes rapid prototyping, validated learning, and iterative product releases.
[
1
]
The goal of this methodology is to shorten product development cycles.
The methodology advocates for building a
minimum viable product
and gathering user feedback to refine the offering of a product over time.
[
2
]
Ries reports developing this approach based on his experiences as a startup advisor and founder, following challenges faced with his first startup.
[
3
]
[
4
]
[
5
]
The lean startup method draws on ideas from lean manufacturing and
agile development
.
[
6
]
[
7
]
It focuses on adapting strategies based on experimentation and user feedback rather than relying on long-term business planning.
Some organizations have implemented the lean startup approach, including
Alphabet Energy
,
Dropbox
,
Wealthfront
,
[

]
and
General Electric
.
[

]
Reception
[
edit
]
According to the publisher, the book's sales exceed one million copies, and it has been translated into over thirty languages.
[
10
]
It also appeared on
The New York Times
Best Sellers list
in the 'Hardcover Advice & Misc.' category in 2011.
[
11
]
Academic responses to the methodology have been mixed. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the
Wharton School of Business
, supported the focus on experimentation and learning but raised concerns about the emphasis on early customer input in cases involving novel technologies.
[
12
]
He also noted limitations in tools such as the business model canvas. Bocken and Snihur conclude that more research is required to understand the process of experimentation, and highlight the limited academic knowledge of the process.

No BS Direct Marketing by Dan Kennedy: Summary / Notes
Skip to content
Here are my notes on No BS Direct Marketing by Dan Kennedy, an established direct marketing guru who has made an empire out of selling direct marketing consulting, training and books for decades.
The book is here on Amazon
.
These are my own notes, but hopefully you’ll find them useful.
Purpose & Audience
No BS Direct Marketing is aimed at businesses not used to doing direct marketing who should make a switch. Most businesses do advertising and marketing the “old” way, advertising their products and services, but don’t make a direct appeal to people.
Primary targets are local businesses, like real estate agents, lawyers, dentists etc. These are businesses that normally advertise their products and services, that should make a switch to direct marketing!
The Rules of Direct Marketing
According to Dan Kennedy in No BS Direct Marketing, these are the rules everyone should adhere to when switching to direct marketing.
There must always be an offer or offers.
There must be a reason to respond right now
You must give clear instructions
There must be tracking, measurement and accountability
There must only be no-cost brand building
There must be follow-up
There must be strong copy
It must look like mail-order advertising
Results rule. Period.
You must be a tough-minded disciplinarian and put your business on a strict direct marketing diet.
Rule 1: There must always be an offer
You have to make an offer your customer
can’t refuse.
Every communication has to ask somebody to do something.
Most marketing doesn’t do this, just talking about something vague but not calling for a response.
You have to ask for action in order to measure and track the performance of every ad.
There are two types of offers. You should always include one, but you can actually include both.
Type 1: Requesting purchase.
Classic offer, like “buy one, get one free” from pizza shops (but never discount!). These are usually married to a hard deadline and are limited.
Disadvantages: They sacrifice price integrity (through discounting) and they can train people to respond only to deals when they’re offered. They can also be comparison shopped easily, and they encourage this.
Despite all this they’re still useful.
Type 2: Lead generation offer.
This is usually free. It’s aimed at building a relationship to avoid waste in advertising.
For example, free information kits with brochures and a DVD. Once someone raises their hand and says “yes, I want that free download!” you know they’re interested in your offer.
Make your lead gen offers easy to accept
You want to make your offers “low threshold resistance”. This is usually free information sent by mail or online.
High threshold is like a discount on a first session at a chiropractor, or even a free appointment with a financial planner. It only gets people who are already convinced they need that thing.
Low threshold is aimed at people who
might
need that thing but really w

Be prepared for some surprises!
Published by BJ Deaton , 4 years ago
I have one more book to read in this series. This one kept me reading into the lives of Chase and Keith and their families and some changes along the way! So glad to have the Baxters within this book- Dayne and Katy, Luke Baxter, and Ashley Baxter Blake. There is some sadness within these pages but some joys as well. The Flanagan family is a good example of what Christian families deal with and work with. Let's not forget Cody Coleman! He has come a long way and has a ways to go. A good read! Onto book 4!
Wonderful Karen!
Published by Thriftbooks.com User , 15 years ago
Karen Kingsbury is truly one of the best christian fiction writers around today, although Francine Rivers is up there to.   'Take Three' will not disappoint fans. In her usual stylish manner she beds difficult and tough life issues into an engaging storyline. I'm sure fans will find this a real page turner if you can excuse the cliche and be left inspired. Some more great christian fiction of note at the moment are 'Godstone' and 'A skeleton in God's closet'.   Godstone - The Kairos Boxes   A Skeleton in God's Closet

Lesley A. DuTemple, Biography:  Jacques Cousteau
Published by Thriftbooks.com User , 21 years ago
This biography of the French oceanographer is written for juveniles and has good pictures. Endnotes, found at pp. 106-07, refer to pages in the text (a fact not noted in the volume), while Madsen's good, but dated, biography appears here, but not in the bibliography. More problematic is the bibliography's use of websites. Unlike books, these are subject to change, and change they have. The site given for a list of Cousteau's videos, www.cousteausociety.org.filmsC.html , no longer exists, and only one video is listed at www.cousteau.org . Similarly, www.dolphinlog.org is now www.cousteaukids.org . At least one of the endnotes, referring to Cousteau weeping when he heard news of the sinking of the Dupleix, gives an incorrect reference in The Silent World (it occurs on p. 34, not p. 31).  DuTemple gives a short treatment of Cousteau's romantic relationship and second family, but avoids any mention of his brother Pierre's collaboration with the Axis during World War II or of Jean-Michael's suit against Jacques over use of the Cousteau Society name. More worrisome in a book for students, the author states, "[i]n September 1939, France and Great Britain declared war on Germany" (at p. 29), adding later, "[t]hen Hitler rolled into Poland" (at p. 30), which indeed many of us thought was the reason for the declaration of war in the first place.  It is also interesting to compare DuTemple's assertion that Cousteau "and a group under his command dove under the ships of the French fleet, placing enough explosives to sink every ship. The fleet could be destroyed if necessary to prevent Hitler from using the ships" (at p. 32)

Heart of a Hero is an excellent three book series
Published by CookB , 6 years ago
Shelley Shepard Gray is an excellent author.  One almost feels like they are part of the story as she weaves an interesting plot. A reader who likes true romance novels with meaning will enjoy this book.  It is very hard to decide after reading 36 of her novels, which is my favorite. I feel confident in recommending this book as well as A Texan's Honor, A Texan's Choice, as well as her Lone Star Hero series, The Loyal Heart, An Uncommon Protector, and Love Held Captive.  One cannot go wrong with reading any of her books.

Crochet For Barbie
Published by Thriftbooks.com User , 16 years ago
Wonderful! I actually learned how to crochet with Barbie and this book. The fashions are so fabulous and elegant even enough for the Silkstones. I have even experimented with the patterns to make them fit Dawn and the Bratz. It's great to have a book full of stylish, contemporary fashions for my beloved dolls. Thank you, Nicky Epstein for such a fab book!

Personalization
In 1974, a young Dan Kennedy sat in his cramped Cleveland apartment, staring at a pile of bills and a typewriter. He had just failed at his third business venture, and his bank account was hovering near zero. What happened next would not only transform his life but revolutionize the entire field of direct response marketing.
Kennedy began writing
sales letters
for local businesses – small, struggling companies that couldn't afford traditional advertising. His first client was a carpet cleaning service. The owner had spent thousands on Yellow Pages ads with minimal results. Kennedy's unconventional sales letter, filled with customer testimonials and a bold guarantee, generated more leads in two weeks than the business had seen in the previous six months.
The Birth of No B.S. Marketing
By 1976, Kennedy's reputation for producing results had spread beyond Cleveland. While mainstream advertising agencies were focused on clever slogans and brand awareness, Kennedy was developing his signature "No B.S." approach. A turning point came when a struggling martial arts school owner approached him for help.
"The owner was spending $2,000 a month on radio ads that mentioned his school name exactly once," Kennedy later recalled. "I replaced it with a direct response ad offering a free trial class and a special report on 'Seven Self-Defense Moves Every Parent Should Teach Their Child.' The school's enrollment doubled in 60 days."
This success crystallized
Kennedy's core principle
: every marketing dollar must be accountable and measurable.
The Psychology of the Sale
Kennedy's deep dive into
consumer psychology
began with an accidental discovery. In 1979, he was working with a high-end jeweler who couldn't move his inventory despite heavy discounting. Kennedy noticed that when the jeweler shared stories about each piece's history and craftsmanship, customers were more likely to buy – even at full price.
This observation led to Kennedy's revolutionary "Story-Selling" method:
The Power of Narrative
A luxury watch dealer in Chicago implemented Kennedy's story-selling technique in 1981. Instead of advertising "50% off," they created detailed histories for each timepiece, complete with craftsman profiles and manufacturing details. Sales increased 312% in three months, with no discounting.
The Emotional Triggers
Through extensive testing across different industries, Kennedy identified seven core emotional triggers that drove purchasing decisions:
Fear of Loss
In 1983, a real estate agent used Kennedy's "fear of loss" trigger in her marketing. Rather than promoting home features, she emphasized the limited availability of properties in desirable school districts. Her commissions tripled that year.
Desire for Gain
A struggling investment newsletter transformed its

was a Chinese general,
military strategist
, and writer who lived during the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China. Sun Tzu is the author of
The Art of War
. This influential military strategy work has influenced Western and East Asian philosophy.
His work focuses more on alternative strategies to war, such as strategy, delay, the use of spying and alternatives to warfare,
making and keeping alliances
, deceit, and submission to stronger foes. Sun Tzu's
The Art of War
has significantly influenced various fields, including business, where its principles are applied to develop effective tactics and strategies against competition.
Sun Tzu is revered as a historical and military legend. In Chinese, Sun Tzu, an honorific, means “Master Sun”.
Sun Tzu’s
historicity
is unclear. His life was dated to 544-496 BC by Sima Qian, a Han dynasty historian, and other Chinese historians. Based on the style of its composition and the descriptions of war, modern scholars accept his historicity.
Since its creation, Sun Tzu’s work has been praised and used in East Asian warfare.
The Art of War
was popular in the 20th century and used in Western society.
It significantly influences many global competitive endeavors, including politics, culture, business, and modern warfare. Sun Tzu’s strategy for winning the conflicts of the time has proven timeless.
It has been applied to business and
managerial strategies
for centuries.
Sun Tzu's
The Art of War
is a timeless treatise on strategy relevant to various fields, including business. While originally written for military application, the principles outlined in this ancient text have been adapted to help leaders navigate competitive landscapes, make strategic decisions, and emerge victorious in business endeavors.
Understanding the Art of War’s Relevance
The core of
The Art of War
lies in its 13 principles, which provide a comprehensive framework for overcoming adversaries and achieving success. These principles, also known as the "art of war rules," can be applied to modern business practices, helping companies anticipate challenges, outmaneuver competitors, and optimize their growth strategies.
Applying the 13 Principles of the Art of War in Business
The
Art of War
is structured around 13 chapters, each detailing a specific aspec

Key Takeaways
Never outshine the master — make those above you feel superior to avoid triggering their insecurity
Conceal your intentions and use misdirection — keep people off-balance by never revealing your true purpose
Reputation is everything — guard it with your life and use it to intimidate and win before any battle begins
Always say less than necessary — the more you say, the more common you appear and the less in control
Win through actions, never through argument — demonstration is more powerful than explanation
Make other people come to you — use bait if necessary, but always operate from a position of control
Learn to keep people dependent on you — be the only one who can do what you do
Master your emotions — never react in anger and always keep others off-balance
Summary
An outstanding book that will no doubt remain a classic for a long time.  48 Laws of Power details the laws for attaining power in life, business, and more, and gives historical examples of each law in practice, as well as examples of those who do not respect these laws.
A book I will continue to go back and reference.  Those who are cynical may see some of the laws as manipulative, and some are. That said, they are all grounded in the reality of human nature, and it's more important to understand them, and then choose how, when, and which to apply, than to just remain ignorant of them and refuse to acknowledge they exist.
A long read, but well worth it and entertaining throughout.

, Robert Greene asserts that whether you like it or not, you’re part of a never-ending game of power. You’re either striving for and wielding power, or you’re a pawn being played by someone more powerful than you. You choose your role.
This book is for those who prefer to be players rather than pawns. To turn you from an amateur into a master player, Greene has codified 48 laws of power based on historical examples of people who’ve excelled or failed at wielding power, with glorious or bloody results (or both). Some key principles you’ll learn: use your enemies, keep others dependent on you, say as little as possible, take credit for others’ work, and don’t get your hands dirty. You can choose to apply or dismiss these rules - but you can’t escape them.

People can’t stand to be powerless. Everyone wants power and is always trying to get more. Striving for and wielding power is a game everyone participates in, whether they want to or not.
You’re either a power player or a pawn someone else is playing with.
In
The 48 Laws of Power
Robert Greene contends that since you can’t opt out of the game of power, you’re better off becoming a master player by learning the rules and strategies practiced since ancient times.
He’s codified 48 laws of power based on examples and writings going back 3,000 years of people who’ve excelled or failed at wielding power, with glorious or bloody results. Greene argues that following the 48 laws will genera

The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene: Notes and Review | Nat Eliason
The 48 Laws of Power
By:
Robert Greene
Categories
:
Strategy, Leadership, History
Finished:
October	13, 2020
Highlights
Law 1:
Never outshine the master
Make your masters appear more brilliant
than they are and you will attain the heights of power
When it comes to power,
outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all
.
Never take your position for granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.
Law 2:
Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies
But
hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend
, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them
Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels.
Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes— maybe they mean it, often they do not
.
The key to power, then, is the ability to
judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations
. Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.
Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions
Use decoyed objects and desires and red herrings to throw people off the scent
Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but
by talking endlessly about your desires and goals— just not your real ones
. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly, open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases.
Use smoke screens to disguise your actions. This derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless person they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else
As Kierkegaard wrote, “The world wants to be deceived.”
Law 4: Always
say less than necessary
One oft-told tale about Kissinger… involved a report that Winston Lord had worked on for days. After giving it to Kissinger, he got it back with the notation, “
Is this the best you can do?
” Lord rewrote and polished and finally resubmitted it; back it came with the same curt question. After redrafting it one more time— and once again getting the same question from Kissinger-Lord snapped, “Damn it, yes, it’s the best I can do. ” To which Kissinger replied: “Fine, then I guess I’ll read it this time. ”
Persons who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is unworthy of respect. But the human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you grief.
Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words
.
Power is in many ways a game of appearances, and when you say less than necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are.

The Prince
(
Italian
:
Il Principe
[il
ˈprintʃipe]
;
Latin
:
De Principatibus
) is a 16th-century political
treatise
written by the Italian diplomat, philosopher, and
political theorist
Niccolò Machiavelli
in the form of a realistic instruction guide for new
princes
. Many commentators have viewed that one of the main themes of
The Prince
is that immoral acts are sometimes necessary to achieve political glory.

From Machiavelli's correspondence, a version was apparently being written in 1513, using a Latin title,
De Principatibus
(
Of Principalities
).
[

]
However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was carried out with the permission of the
Medici
pope
Clement VII
, but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of
The Prince
in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".
[

]
Although
The Prince
was written as if it were a traditional work in the
mirrors for princes
style, it was generally agreed as being especially innovative. This is partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice that had become increasingly popular since the publication of
Dante
's
Divine Comedy
and other works of Renaissance literature.

Machiavelli illustrates his reasoning using remarkable comparisons of classical, biblical, and medieval events, including many seemingly positive references to the murderous career of
Cesare Borgia
, which occurred during Machiavelli's own diplomatic career.
[

The Prince
is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of
modern philosophy
, especially modern
political philosophy
, in which practical effect is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Its worldview came in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and
scholastic
doctrines of the time, particularly those on politics and ethics.

This short treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli's works, and the most responsible for the later pejorative use of the word "
Machiavellian
". It even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words "
politics
" and "
politician
" in Western countries.

In subject matter, it overlaps with the much longer
Discourses on Livy
, which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for political ends, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli to which

Text on kenjutsu and the martial arts in general
The Book of Five Rings
Author
Miyamoto Musashi
Original title
五輪書
Genre
Kenjutsu
and the
martial arts
Publication date
1645
The Book of Five Rings
(
五輪書
,
Go Rin no Sho
)
is a text on
kenjutsu
and the
martial arts
in general, written by the Japanese swordsman
Miyamoto Musashi
between 1643-5.
[

]
The book title from
the
godai
(五大) of
Buddhist
esotericism
(
密教
), thus has five volumes: "Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Sky." Many translations have been made, and it has garnered broad attention in
East Asia
and throughout the world. For instance, some foreign business leaders find its discussion of conflict to be
relevant to their work
. The modern-day
Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū
employs it as a manual of technique and philosophy.

Go Rin no Sho
calligraphed
in
Kanji
. Musashi strove to be as great a master in
Japanese calligraphy
just as much as he did in swordsmanship.
Musashi establishes a "no-nonsense" theme throughout the text. For instance, he repeatedly remarks that technical flourishes are excessive, and contrasts worrying about such things with the principle that all technique is simply a method of cutting down one's opponent. He also continually makes the point that the understandings expressed in the book are important for combat on any scale, whether a one-on-one
duel
or a massive
battle
. Descriptions of principles are often followed by admonitions to "investigate this thoroughly" through practice rather than trying to learn them by merely reading.
