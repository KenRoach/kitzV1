Understands your document structure
Smart Document Understanding (SDU) is a visual machine learning tool that enables users to label text so that the tool builds an understanding of critical components inside your enterprise documents, such as headers, tables and more. Once you annotate a few pages of your documents, SDU can teach itself the rest, retrieving answers and information only from relevant content.
How to use SDU
Create a project
Convert images of text into insights
IBM’s new OCR provides higher character accuracy and detection recall giving you greater extraction of key insights from documents in sub-optimal conditions such as irregular fonts, insufficient resolution, bad lighting from mobile capture and even variety of colors and backgrounds.
Explore IBM's new OCR technology
Navigate through your data to discover insights
Traditional enterprise search engines perform keyword searches and provide end-users with links to documentation. But with Watson Discovery, you move beyond keyword search to navigate confidently through your documents using faceted search to find the relevant information needed. The design of this platform ensures that the information you need is easily accessible and can push to downstream automation via JSON output.
More about faceted navigation
Offers NLP enrichments
The platform’s out-of-the-box NLP enrichments include entity extraction, sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, keyword extractions, category classification, concept tagging and more.
How to enrich your data
Leverages large language models (LLMs)
IBM Watson Discovery uses foundation models from Watson Natural Language Processing (NLP) for advanced processing and understanding of text, enabling the accurate extraction of information and insights from business documents, accelerating processes and generating insights.
