How did email marketing begin?
Email marketing began in 1978, as the first email was sent 7 years earlier and marketing experts decided that trying to promote a business through email was a good idea. This is likely to be a surprise to most people because most people really didn't have access to the internet until years later.
However, it is true, that email marketing originated as early as it did, and the very first marketing campaign was carried out by a marketing professional who opted to send out marketing emails to a target group of 400 businesses. His efforts were rewarded by
receiving over $13 million in sales
, and email marketing took off from there.
Of course, email marketing has evolved significantly over the years, but it has always remained the same in a way. Email marketing was a success during its early days as well as it is now for the same reason: because it works.
How do email marketing campaigns work?
Email marketing campaigns are simple: They work because they target a predetermined group of people, or a company's target audience.

OUR SERVICES
Difficult messaging problems are our favorite.
The world needs to see your brand the way you see your brand. And achieving that goal is not as hard as it may feel. We love working with complex brands in new and saturated spaces to identify ideal positioning, determine your “phrase that pays” and develop living messaging guides that your whole team can use. To stay on message. And grow.
Positioning & differentiation.
We help teams identify their value and how its delivery gets communicated. If you’re struggling with differentiation and you can see, in the data, that you are losing revenue and/or market share because something’s getting lost between the boardroom and mainstreet, let’s talk.
Narrative architecture.
Got a story? Growth-focused companies need a strong narrative as part of differentiation and awareness-building. Let’s work together to find your story and tell it in fascinating ways.
Are we a great fit?
Messaging in a time of AI.
As the shine of AI writing tools wears off, we’re seeing “AI powered” marketers left more confused than ever. We work with teams to turn AI into the tool (not strategy) that it is. So everyone brings their brains back online. And messaging gets measurably better.
WHY THIS MATTERS
If your team is confused about messaging, everyone feels it
Harvard reports that senior leaders spend more than 30% of their day correcting messaging errors, inconsistencies and fails. And product managers indicate that messaging execution is a top obstacle to hitting deadlines and growth targets, following only budget limitations. The result? As PwC reports, only 2.5% of companies complete projects on time.
Eliminate guesswork.
