**Deep Enrichment (Knowledge Base):**

```
DEMAND GENERATION FRAMEWORK (from HubSpot methodology):

Definition: Demand generation is the process of creating awareness and demand for
your products/services. Unlike lead generation (which captures existing demand),
demand gen CREATES demand through education and trust-building.

THE DEMAND GEN FUNNEL:
1. AWARENESS: Content marketing, social media, SEO, PR, events
   - Goal: Target audience discovers your brand
   - Tactics: Blog posts, videos, podcasts, social content, guest appearances
   - Metrics: Traffic, impressions, reach, share of voice

2. INTEREST: Lead magnets, webinars, guides, email nurture
   - Goal: Audience engages deeply with your content
   - Tactics: Ebooks, templates, checklists, free tools, webinars
   - Metrics: Downloads, email signups, content engagement

3. CONSIDERATION: Case studies, demos, comparisons, free trials
   - Goal: Prospect evaluates your solution vs alternatives
   - Tactics: Product tours, case studies, ROI calculators, consultations
   - Metrics: Demo requests, trial signups, sales conversations

4. DECISION: Proposals, negotiations, onboarding
   - Goal: Prospect becomes customer
   - Tactics: Custom proposals, limited-time offers, onboarding support
   - Metrics: Conversion rate, deal size, time to close

KEY DEMAND GEN STRATEGIES:
- Content marketing: Consistently publish valuable, educational content
- Account-based marketing: Target specific high-value accounts
- Social selling: Build relationships on LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp
- Event marketing: Webinars, workshops, community events
- Partnership marketing: Co-marketing with complementary businesses
- Referral programs: Systematize word-of-mouth

KITZ RELEVANCE FOR LATAM SMBs:
- WhatsApp IS the demand gen channel for LATAM (not email/LinkedIn)
- Instagram Reels + WhatsApp is the dominant LATAM acquisition flow
- Content in Spanish/Portuguese is undersupplied vs English
- Community-based marketing is more effective in LATAM culture
- Price sensitivity means free content/tools outperform paid ads
- KITZ should help users build systematic demand gen processes

How did email marketing begin?
Email marketing began in 1978, as the first email was sent 7 years earlier and marketing experts decided that trying to promote a business through email was a good idea. This is likely to be a surprise to most people because most people really didn't have access to the internet until years later.
However, it is true, that email marketing originated as early as it did, and the very first marketing campaign was carried out by a marketing professional who opted to send out marketing emails to a target group of 400 businesses. His efforts were rewarded by
receiving over $13 million in sales
, and email marketing took off from there.
Of course, email marketing has evolved significantly over the years, but it has always remained the same in a way. Email marketing was a success during its early days as well as it is now for the same reason: because it works.
How do email marketing campaigns work?
Email marketing campaigns are simple: They work because they target a predetermined group of people, or a company's target audience.
Before a business can begin a campaign, it must determine its email marketing strategy, which means deciding on a target audience. It is possible to have more than one target audience, which is great, because the bigger the size of the target audience, the better. Regardless of the size, once the target audience has been identified, a company can then have its marketing experts begin developing a customized marketing strategy.
The use of newsletters is an excellent email marketing strategy that can be used to captivate your audience with an abundan

```
REFORGE -- GROWTH STRATEGY PLATFORM:

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
Reforge is a professional education platform for experienced growth, marketing, and
product professionals. Founded by Brian Balfour (former VP Growth at HubSpot), it
offers deep, framework-driven programs on growth strategy.

KEY FRAMEWORKS (from Reforge methodology):

1. GROWTH LOOPS (vs Funnels):
   - Input -> Action -> Output that feeds back as Input
   - Example: User signs up -> Invites friend -> Friend signs up (viral loop)
   - Example: Content created -> SEO traffic -> New users -> More content
   - Loops are sustainable; funnels leak

2. ACQUISITION STRATEGY:
   - Paid: Scalable but requires budget (Meta, Google, TikTok)
   - Viral: Product-driven sharing (referrals, invites, network effects)
   - Content: SEO, social, community (compounds over time)
   - Sales: Direct outreach (higher CAC but higher LTV)

3. RETENTION & ENGAGEMENT:
   - Setup moment: First action that delivers value
   - Aha moment: When user understands the product's value
   - Habit moment: When product becomes part of routine
   - Activation metrics: Track the path to each moment

4. MONETIZATION:
   - Value metric: What you charge for (users, transactions, features)
   - Pricing model: Freemium, trial, tiered, usage-based
   - Expansion revenue: Upsell, cross-sell, seat expansion
   - Willingness to pay research: Van Westendorp, MaxDiff

KITZ RELEVANCE FOR LATAM SMBs:
- Growth loops thinking should inform KITZ product design
- KITZ's own growth: WhatsApp sharing loop (user tells friend via WA)
- Retention framework: Define KITZ's setup/aha/habit moments
- For KITZ users: Teach growth principles in simple, actionable terms
- Reforge content is premium ($3,995/program) but frameworks are public

OUR SERVICES
Difficult messaging problems are our favorite.
The world needs to see your brand the way you see your brand. And achieving that goal is not as hard as it may feel. We love working with complex brands in new and saturated spaces to identify ideal positioning, determine your “phrase that pays” and develop living messaging guides that your whole team can use. To stay on message. And grow.
Positioning & differentiation.
We help teams identify their value and how its delivery gets communicated. If you’re struggling with differentiation and you can see, in the data, that you are losing revenue and/or market share because something’s getting lost between the boardroom and mainstreet, let’s talk.
Narrative architecture.
Got a story? Growth-focused companies need a strong narrative as part of differentiation and awareness-building. Let’s work together to find your story and tell it in fascinating ways.
Are we a great fit?
Messaging in a time of AI.
As the shine of AI writing tools wears off, we’re seeing “AI powered” marketers left more confused than ever. We work with teams to turn AI into the tool (not strategy) that it is. So everyone brings their brains back online. And messaging gets measurably better.
WHY THIS MATTERS
If your team is confused about messaging, everyone feels it
Harvard reports that senior leaders spend more than 30% of their day correcting messaging errors, inconsistencies and fails. And product managers indicate that messaging execution is a top obstacle to hitting deadlines and growth targets, following only budget limitations. The result? As PwC reports, only 2.5% of companies complete projects on time.
Eliminate guesswork.
A 2024 study found that, when tech employees are uncertain of how to do their job, turnover increases. By eliminating guesswork in your brand’s messaging, you can retain your hard-won team members.
Add the why to the how.
Does something get lost between the moment your leaders establish the message and the moment your copywriters execute on it? Marry the why with the how for better results.
Generate revenue.
Any message with the power to grow your business has the power to shrink it. When you unlock messaging excellence, you unlock revenue growth. On average, we generate >100% YoY gr

DEEP ENRICHMENT -- THE STORYBRAND FRAMEWORK (SB7):

The StoryBrand Framework is a 7-part messaging framework based on classic
storytelling structure. It clarifies business messaging so customers engage.

THE 7 ELEMENTS:
1. A CHARACTER (Hero = Your Customer)
   - The customer is the hero, NOT your brand
   - Define what the customer WANTS (external desire)
   - "A financial advisor who helps families..." -> families are the hero

2. HAS A PROBLEM
   - Villain: The root cause (not the symptom)
   - External problem: The tangible challenge
   - Internal problem: How it makes them FEEL
   - Philosophical problem: Why it's just plain WRONG
   - Example: "Running a business shouldn't require an MBA" (philosophical)

3. AND MEETS A GUIDE (You/Your Brand)
   - Your brand is the GUIDE, not the hero
   - Demonstrate EMPATHY: "We understand how hard it is..."
   - Demonstrate AUTHORITY: Testimonials, stats, credentials
   - Guide = Yoda, Hero = Luke Skywalker

4. WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN
   - Process plan: "3 easy steps to get started"
   - Agreement plan: Promise that reduces risk
   - Reduce confusion -- clarity = trust
   - Example: "1. Sign up 2. Connect WhatsApp 3. Start selling"

5. AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION
   - Direct CTA: "Start Free Trial" (clear, bold, primary)
   - Transitional CTA: "Download Free Guide" (for not-ready-yet leads)
   - MUST be clear and specific -- "Get Started" is better than "Learn More"

6. THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE
   - Paint the picture of what happens WITHOUT your product
   - Stakes create urgency: "Don't lose another customer to..."
   - Be honest but not manipulative

7. AND ENDS IN SUCCESS
   - Show the transformation: Before vs After
   - Status transformation: How will others see them?
   - What does their life look like after using your product?

KITZ APPLICATION:
- Character: The LATAM entrepreneur (25-45, selling via WhatsApp)
- Problem: External: No tools. Internal: Overwhelmed. Philosophical: Hustlers deserve infrastructure
- Guide: KITZ (empathy + authority through AI capabilities)
- Plan: 1. Connect WhatsApp 2. KITZ learns your business 3. Grow with AI
- CTA: "Start Free" (direct) / "See How KITZ Works" (transitional)
- Failure: Stay informal, lose customers, burn out
- Success: Organized, growing, professional business owner

This framework should inform ALL KITZ messaging and marketing copy.
