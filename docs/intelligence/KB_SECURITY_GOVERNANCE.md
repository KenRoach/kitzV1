What is the EU AI Act?
The AI Act
is a European regulation on artificial intelligence (AI) – the first comprehensive regulation on AI by a major regulator anywhere. The Act assigns applications of AI to three risk categories. First, applications and systems that create an
unacceptable risk
, such as government-run social scoring of the type used in China, are banned. Second,
high-risk applications
, such as a CV-scanning tool that ranks job applicants, are subject to specific legal requirements. Lastly, applications not explicitly banned or listed as high-risk are largely left unregulated.
Why should you care?
AI applications influence what information you see online by predicting what content is engaging to you,
capture and analyse data from faces
to enforce laws or personalise advertisements, and are used to diagnose and treat cancer. In other words,

.
Like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, the EU AI Act could become a
