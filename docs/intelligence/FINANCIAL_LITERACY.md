## 1.4 Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)

### MFI Landscape in LatAm

Latin America is one of the most developed microfinance markets globally. Brazil and
Mexico hold over 50% of the region's total microfinance portfolio.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total MFI portfolio (LatAm) | ~$50B+ |
| Number of borrowers | ~30M+ |
| Average microloan size | $500 - $5,000 |
| Leading markets | Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Mexico, Brazil |

### Key MFIs

| Institution | Country | Borrowers | Specialty |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Compartamos Banco | Mexico | 3M+ | Group and individual microloans |
| Mibanco | Peru | 2M+ | Largest microfinance bank in LatAm |
| BancoSol | Bolivia | 400K+ | Pioneer in microfinance banking |
| Banco FIE | Bolivia | 500K+ | Full-service microfinance bank |
| CrediAmigo (BNB) | Brazil | 2M+ | Largest microfinance program in South America |
| Fundacion WWB Colombia | Colombia | 300K+ | Women-focused microfinance |

### Typical Rates and Terms

| Product | Rate Range (Annual) | Term | Amount |
|---------|-------------------|------|--------|

### Group Solidarity Lending Model (Grupo Solidario)

The solidarity group model, pioneered by Grameen Bank and widely adopted across LatAm,
works as follows:

1. **Formation:** 5-30 individuals form a group
2. **Joint liability:** All members guarantee each other's loans
3. **Social pressure:** Default by one member affects all; strong repayment incentive
4. **Graduated lending:** Successful repayment unlocks larger loans for the whole group
5. **No collateral:** The group guarantee replaces traditional collateral
6. **Weekly meetings:** Payments collected in group meetings, building community and accountability

**Advantages:** Reaches the unbanked; 95%+ repayment rates typical
**Disadvantages:** Can create social tension; limits individual loan sizes

### Impact on Financial Inclusion

- Over 60% of MFI borrowers in LatAm are women
- First-time credit access for ~40% of borrowers
- Formalization catalyst: MFI credit often motivates business registration
- Savings mobilization: Many MFIs now offer savings products alongside credit

## 1.5 Alternative Financing

### Factoring / Invoice Discounting

**How it works:** Business sells its unpaid invoices (cuentas por cobrar) to a factor at a
discount (typically 2-5% of invoice value) and receives immediate cash.

| Country | Factoring Landscape | Key Players |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Brazil | Most developed; government-backed electronic invoice (Nota Fiscal Eletronica) enables digital factoring | FIDC funds, BRL factoring platforms |
| Mexico | Growing rapidly; Nafin Cadenas Productivas is largest reverse factoring program | Nafin, Konfio, independent factors |
| Colombia | Regulated by Decree 1154/2020; DIAN's RADIAN system tracks transactions | Mesfix, independent factors |
| Peru | SUNAT electronic invoice mandate since 2022 enabled SME factoring | Facturedo, independent factors |

**South America factoring market:** Projected to exceed USD $60B by 2030.

### Crowdfunding Platforms

| Platform | Country | Type | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|

- **Angel investor networks:** Mexico (Angel Ventures, Mexican.vc), Colombia (Angels Nest), Brazil (Anjos do Brasil)
- **Revenue-based financing:** Growing model where investor takes percentage of monthly revenue until a multiple is repaid
- **SMB-focused funds:** Some impact investors specifically target LatAm SMBs

### Supplier Financing (Credito de Proveedores)

The most common form of SMB financing in LatAm (and often overlooked):

- **Net 30/60/90:** Standard payment terms extended by suppliers
- **Cost:** Usually "free" but often built into pricing (2-5% implicit cost)
- **Pronto pago discount:** Suppliers may offer 2-3% discount for early payment
- **Strategy:** Negotiate longer supplier terms while collecting from customers faster

### Equipment Leasing (Arrendamiento)

- **Operating lease (arrendamiento puro):** Use equipment; return at end of term
- **Finance lease (arrendamiento financiero):** Own equipment at end of term (opcion de compra)
- **Tax benefit:** Lease payments often fully deductible as operating expense
- **Providers:** Major banks + specialized lessors (e.g., Unifin in Mexico, before restructuring)

# Part 3: Accounting Basics for SMB Owners

## 3.1 Financial Statements Explained (Plain Language)

### Estado de Resultados (P&L / Income Statement)

**What it answers:** "Am I making money or losing money, and where is the money going?"

```
+ Ingresos (Revenue)                     What you earned from sales
- Costo de ventas (COGS)                 What it cost you to make/buy what you sold
= Utilidad bruta (Gross Profit)          What's left after direct costs
- Gastos operativos (Operating Expenses) Rent, salaries, marketing, utilities, etc.
= Utilidad operativa (Operating Income)  Profit from core business operations
- Gastos financieros (Interest/Finance)  Loan interest, bank fees
- Impuestos (Taxes)                      Income tax provision
= Utilidad neta (Net Income)             Your actual bottom-line profit
```

**Key insight:** A business can have strong revenue but negative net income if costs are
too high. The P&L shows you WHERE the money goes.

**Frequency:** Review monthly. Compare to prior months and same month last year.

### Balance General (Balance Sheet)

**What it answers:** "What does the business own, what does it owe, and what's left for the owners?"

```
ACTIVOS (Assets) = PASIVOS (Liabilities) + CAPITAL (Equity)

Assets (what you own):                 Liabilities (what you owe):
  Efectivo (Cash)                        Proveedores (Accounts payable)
  Cuentas por cobrar (Receivables)       Prestamos (Loans)
  Inventario (Inventory)                 Impuestos por pagar (Taxes payable)
  Equipo (Equipment)                     Nomina por pagar (Payroll payable)
  Propiedades (Property)

                                       Capital (what belongs to owners):
                                         Capital social (Invested capital)
                                         Utilidades retenidas (Retained earnings)
```

**Key insight:** The balance sheet is a snapshot at a moment in time. Assets must always
equal liabilities plus equity. If your liabilities exceed your assets, the business is
technically insolvent.

### Flujo de Efectivo (Cash Flow Statement)

**What it answers:** "Where did cash actually come from, and where did it actually go?"

```
Flujo operativo (Operating):    Cash from day-to-day business
  + Cash collected from customers
  - Cash paid to suppliers
  - Cash paid for salaries
  - Cash paid for rent and expenses
  - Cash paid for taxes

Flujo de inversion (Investing): Cash for long-term assets
  - Equipment purchased
  - Property acquired
  + Equipment sold

Flujo de financiamiento (Financing): Cash from/to capital sources
  + Loan proceeds received
  - Loan principal repaid
  + Owner investment
  - Owner withdrawals / dividends
```

**Key insight:** A profitable business can run out of cash (and die) if it doesn't manage
cash flow. You can show a profit on the P&L while having zero cash in the bank. This
statement tells you why.

### The Relationship Between Them

```
P&L tells you:     "Are we profitable?"      (over a period)
Balance Sheet:      "What's our position?"    (at a point in time)
Cash Flow:          "Can we pay our bills?"   (over a period)

Net Income (P&L) --flows into--> Retained Earnings (Balance Sheet)
Cash Flow Statement --explains--> Change in Cash (Balance Sheet)
```

**The most dangerous trap for SMBs:** Confusing profit with cash. You can book a sale
(revenue on P&L) before the customer pays you (no cash yet). This is why many growing
businesses go bankrupt -- they are "profitable" but cannot pay their bills.

## 3.2 Key Metrics Every SMB Should Track

### Revenue & Growth Metrics

```typescript
// === Revenue Growth Rate ===
// "How fast is my business growing?"
function revenueGrowthRate(currentPeriod: number, previousPeriod: number): number {
  if (previousPeriod === 0) return currentPeriod > 0 ? Infinity : 0;
  return ((currentPeriod - previousPeriod) / previousPeriod) * 100;
}
// Example: Revenue grew from $10,000 to $12,000 = 20% growth

// === Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) ===
// For service/subscription businesses: predictable monthly income
interface MRRBreakdown {
  newMRR: number;        // MRR from new customers this month
  expansionMRR: number;  // MRR increase from existing customers (upsells)
  churnMRR: number;      // MRR lost from cancellations
  netNewMRR: number;     // Net change
  totalMRR: number;      // Running total
}

function calculateMRR(
  previousMRR: number,
  newCustomerRevenue: number,
  expansionRevenue: number,
  churnedRevenue: number
): MRRBreakdown {
  const netNew = newCustomerRevenue + expansionRevenue - churnedRevenue;
  return {
    newMRR: newCustomerRevenue,
    expansionMRR: expansionRevenue,
    churnMRR: churnedRevenue,
    netNewMRR: netNew,
    totalMRR: previousMRR + netNew,
  };
}
```

### Profitability Metrics

```typescript
// === Gross Margin ===
// "How much do I keep after paying for what I sell?"
// Target: 40-70% for services, 20-50% for retail/products
function grossMargin(revenue: number, cogs: number): number {
  if (revenue === 0) return 0;
  return ((revenue - cogs) / revenue) * 100;
}

// === Net Margin ===
// "How much of every dollar of revenue becomes actual profit?"
// Target: 5-15% for most SMBs; 15%+ is excellent
function netMargin(revenue: number, netIncome: number): number {
  if (revenue === 0) return 0;
  return (netIncome / revenue) * 100;
}

// === EBITDA Margin ===
// "How profitable is the core business before financing and accounting decisions?"
function ebitdaMargin(
  revenue: number,
  operatingExpenses: number,
  depreciation: number,
  amortization: number
): number {
  if (revenue === 0) return 0;
  const ebitda = revenue - operatingExpenses + depreciation + amortization;
  return (ebitda / revenue) * 100;
}
```

### Cash & Survival Metrics

```typescript
// === Burn Rate ===
// "How fast am I spending cash?" (critical for new businesses)
function monthlyBurnRate(startingCash: number, endingCash: number, months: number): number {
  return (startingCash - endingCash) / months;
}

// === Cash Runway ===
// "How many months until I run out of cash?"
function cashRunway(currentCash: number, monthlyBurnRate: number): number {
  if (monthlyBurnRate <= 0) return Infinity; // Not burning cash
  return currentCash / monthlyBurnRate;
}
// Example: $50,000 cash / $10,000 monthly burn = 5 months runway
// Rule of thumb: Always maintain 3+ months runway

// === Break-Even Point ===
// "How much do I need to sell to cover all my costs?"
interface BreakEvenResult {
  units: number;
  revenue: number;
  monthlyUnits: number;    // Units needed per month
  dailyUnits: number;      // Units needed per day
}

function calculateBreakEven(
  monthlyFixedCosts: number,
  pricePerUnit: number,
  variableCostPerUnit: number
): BreakEvenResult {
  const contributionMargin = pricePerUnit - variableCostPerUnit;
  if (contributionMargin <= 0) {
    throw new Error(
      'Price must exceed variable cost per unit. ' +
      'You lose money on every sale -- raise prices or reduce costs.'
    );
  }
  const monthlyUnits = monthlyFixedCosts / contributionMargin;
  return {
    units: Math.ceil(monthlyUnits * 12),
    revenue: Math.ceil(monthlyUnits * 12) * pricePerUnit,
    monthlyUnits: Math.ceil(monthlyUnits),
    dailyUnits: Math.ceil(monthlyUnits / 30),
  };
}

// Example:
// Fixed costs: $5,000/month (rent, salaries, insurance)
// Price per unit: $50
// Variable cost per unit: $20 (materials, shipping)
// Break-even: 167 units/month = ~6 units/day
```

### Customer Economics

```typescript
// === Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ===
// "How much does it cost to get one new customer?"
function customerAcquisitionCost(
  totalMarketingSpend: number,
  totalSalesSpend: number,
  newCustomersAcquired: number
): number {
  if (newCustomersAcquired === 0) return Infinity;
  return (totalMarketingSpend + totalSalesSpend) / newCustomersAcquired;
}

// === Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) ===
// "How much total revenue will a customer generate over their lifetime?"
function customerLifetimeValue(
  averageMonthlyRevenue: number,
  grossMarginPercent: number,
  avgCustomerLifetimeMonths: number
): number {
  return averageMonthlyRevenue * (grossMarginPercent / 100) * avgCustomerLifetimeMonths;
}

// === LTV:CAC Ratio ===
// Target: 3:1 or higher (customer is worth 3x what it costs to acquire)
// Below 1:1 = losing money on every customer
function ltvCacRatio(ltv: number, cac: number): number {
  if (cac === 0) return Infinity;
  return ltv / cac;
}

// === CAC Payback Period ===
// "How many months until a customer pays back their acquisition cost?"
function cacPaybackMonths(
  cac: number,
  averageMonthlyRevenue: number,
  grossMarginPercent: number
): number {
  const monthlyGrossProfit = averageMonthlyRevenue * (grossMarginPercent / 100);
  if (monthlyGrossProfit <= 0) return Infinity;
  return cac / monthlyGrossProfit;
}
// Target: Under 12 months payback
```

### Operational Efficiency

```typescript
// === DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) ===
// "How long does it take customers to pay me?"
// Lower is better. Target: under 30 days for most businesses.
function daysSalesOutstanding(
  accountsReceivable: number,
  annualRevenue: number
): number {
  if (annualRevenue === 0) return 0;
  return (accountsReceivable / annualRevenue) * 365;
}

// === DPO (Days Payable Outstanding) ===
// "How long do I take to pay my suppliers?"
// Strategy: DPO should be HIGHER than DSO (collect before you pay)
function daysPayableOutstanding(
  accountsPayable: number,
  annualCOGS: number
): number {
  if (annualCOGS === 0) return 0;
  return (accountsPayable / annualCOGS) * 365;
}

// === Cash Conversion Cycle ===
// "How many days does it take to turn inventory investment into cash?"
// Lower (even negative) is better.
function cashConversionCycle(dso: number, dio: number, dpo: number): number {
  return dso + dio - dpo;
  // DSO: days to collect from customers
  // DIO: days inventory sits before being sold
  // DPO: days to pay suppliers
}

// === Inventory Turnover ===
// "How many times per year do I sell through my entire inventory?"
// Higher is better. Target depends on industry.
function inventoryTurnover(annualCOGS: number, averageInventory: number): number {
  if (averageInventory === 0) return Infinity;
  return annualCOGS / averageInventory;
}

// Days Inventory Outstanding
function daysInventoryOutstanding(annualCOGS: number, averageInventory: number): number {
  const turnover = inventoryTurnover(annualCOGS, averageInventory);
  if (turnover === 0) return Infinity;
  return 365 / turnover;

## 3.3 Break-Even Analysis (Detailed)

### The Concept (Plain Language)

Break-even is the point where your revenue exactly equals your total costs. Below this
point, you lose money. Above it, you make a profit.

```
Revenue
  ^
  |                    /  Revenue line
  |                   /
  |                  / * * * PROFIT ZONE
  |                 / * *
  |         ------/-------- Break-even point
  |        /     / * *
  |       /     / LOSS ZONE
  |      /     /
  |     /     / Total cost line
  |    /     /
  |   /     / (Fixed costs form the baseline)
  |--/-----/------ Fixed cost line
  |       /
  +----------------------------> Units sold
```

### Fixed vs Variable Costs for LatAm SMBs

| Fixed Costs (Costos Fijos) | Variable Costs (Costos Variables) |
|---|---|
| Rent (alquiler/renta) | Raw materials (materia prima) |
| Salaries (nomina fija) | Packaging (empaque) |
| Insurance (seguros) | Shipping (envio/flete) |
| Loan payments (pagos de credito) | Sales commissions (comisiones) |
| Software subscriptions | Credit card processing fees |
| Accounting fees (honorarios del contador) | Marketplace fees (Mercado Libre, etc.) |
| Utilities -- base charges (servicios basicos) | Utilities -- variable portion |
| Depreciation (depreciacion) | Direct labor per unit (mano de obra directa) |

### Multi-Product Break-Even

```typescript
// Most SMBs sell multiple products. Use weighted contribution margin.
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  variableCost: number;
  salesMixPercent: number; // What % of total sales is this product?
}

function multiProductBreakEven(
  monthlyFixedCosts: number,
  products: Product[]
): {
  totalRevenueNeeded: number;
  byProduct: { name: string; unitsNeeded: number; revenueNeeded: number }[];
} {
  // Calculate weighted average contribution margin
  const weightedCM = products.reduce((sum, p) => {
    const cm = (p.price - p.variableCost) / p.price; // CM ratio
    return sum + cm * (p.salesMixPercent / 100);
  }, 0);

  const totalRevenue = monthlyFixedCosts / weightedCM;

  const byProduct = products.map(p => {
    const productRevenue = totalRevenue * (p.salesMixPercent / 100);
    const productUnits = Math.ceil(productRevenue / p.price);
    return {
      name: p.name,
      unitsNeeded: productUnits,
      revenueNeeded: productRevenue,
    };
  });

  return { totalRevenueNeeded: totalRevenue, byProduct };
}

// Example: A taqueria in Mexico City
const taqueriaProducts: Product[] = [
  { name: 'Tacos (orden de 3)', price: 75, variableCost: 25, salesMixPercent: 50 },
  { name: 'Bebidas', price: 35, variableCost: 10, salesMixPercent: 25 },
  { name: 'Quesadillas', price: 60, variableCost: 20, salesMixPercent: 15 },
  { name: 'Postres', price: 45, variableCost: 12, salesMixPercent: 10 },
];

const result = multiProductBreakEven(85000, taqueriaProducts);
// monthlyFixedCosts: MXN $85,000 (rent $25K, salaries $45K, utilities $8K, other $7K)
```

## 3.6 When to Hire an Accountant

### DIY vs Accountant Decision Framework

```
DO IT YOURSELF (DIY) if:
  [x] You are a sole proprietor / MEI / monotributista
  [x] You have fewer than 5 employees
  [x] Your revenue is under $50K USD/year
  [x] You are in a simplified tax regime (Simples, Monotributo, NRUS)
  [x] You have a simple business model (one revenue stream)
  [x] You are comfortable with cloud accounting software
  [x] You are willing to learn basic bookkeeping

HIRE AN ACCOUNTANT if:
  [x] You have employees (payroll is complex in LatAm)
  [x] Your revenue exceeds regime thresholds (forced into general regime)
  [x] You operate in multiple tax jurisdictions
  [x] You deal with international transactions or imports
  [x] You have inventory-heavy operations
  [x] You need to apply for bank financing (banks want "real" financials)
  [x] You receive government inspection (fiscalizacion) notices
  [x] You have been fined for tax non-compliance
  [x] Tax law changes and you don't understand the impact

HIRE A FULL-TIME CFO / FINANCIAL DIRECTOR if:
  [x] Revenue exceeds ~$1M USD/year
  [x] Multiple business entities or subsidiaries
  [x] Complex capital structure (investors, loans, equity)
  [x] Planning for exit, acquisition, or major investment round
```

### What to Look for in a LatAm Accountant (Contador)

1. **License/Registration:**
   - Mexico: Cedula profesional from SEP (mandatory)
   - Brazil: CRC (Conselho Regional de Contabilidade) registration
   - Colombia: Tarjeta profesional from Junta Central de Contadores
   - Chile: Titulo profesional (not strictly regulated but important)
   - Argentina: Matricula from Consejo Profesional de Ciencias Economicas

2. **Specialization:**
   - Find a contador who works with businesses your size and in your industry
   - A contador who only handles large corporations may not understand SMB challenges
   - A contador who only does personal taxes may not handle business payroll well

3. **Technology adoption:**
   - Uses cloud-based accounting software (not just Excel)
   - Files electronically (not paper-based)
   - Can communicate digitally (WhatsApp, email, client portal)
   - Understands e-commerce, fintechs, and digital businesses

4. **Red flags:**
   - Suggests hiding income or inflating expenses
   - Cannot explain tax strategies in plain language
   - Takes weeks to respond to questions
   - Has no formal credentials
   - Does not provide engagement letter or contract

5. **Questions to ask:**
   - "How many SMB clients of my size do you serve?"
   - "What software do you use?"
   - "How will you communicate filing deadlines to me?"
   - "What happens if the tax authority audits me?"
   - "Can you help me understand my financial statements, not just prepare them?"

### Typical Monthly Accountant Fees by Country

Annual returns, audits, and special projects (company formation, restructuring) are
typically billed separately.

### Online / Low-Cost Accounting Options

The rise of online accounting firms (contabilidade online) is reducing costs dramatically,
especially in Brazil:

- **Brazil:** Online firms like Contabilizei, Agilize, and MEU Contador Online offer plans
  starting at R$99-249/month for micro-businesses
- **Mexico:** Platforms like Konta and Enconta offer monthly accounting from MXN $1,500+
- **Colombia:** Siigo + independent contadores offer bundled software + service plans
- **Regional:** Alegra's marketplace connects businesses with vetted accountants in multiple countries
