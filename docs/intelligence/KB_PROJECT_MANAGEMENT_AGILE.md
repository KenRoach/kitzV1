> Module: Project Management | Auto-generated supplementary intelligence
> Purpose: Help KITZ users and the KITZ team manage projects effectively using lean/agile methods

## Project Management Fundamentals for SMBs

### Why SMBs Need Project Management
- **Execution speed** — Move from idea to revenue faster
- **Resource efficiency** — Do more with less (typical SMB reality)
- **Accountability** — Clear ownership of tasks and deadlines
- **Visibility** — Know what's in progress, blocked, or done
- **Customer alignment** — Build what customers actually want

## Lean Methodology

### Core Principles
1. **Eliminate waste** — Remove anything that doesn't add customer value
2. **Build quality in** — Don't inspect for quality, build it into the process
3. **Create knowledge** — Learn from every iteration
4. **Defer commitment** — Make decisions at the last responsible moment
5. **Deliver fast** — Short cycle times, frequent releases
6. **Respect people** — Trust teams to make decisions
7. **Optimize the whole** — System-level thinking, not local optimization

### Lean Startup Method (Build-Measure-Learn)
1. **Build**: Create minimum viable product (MVP) — smallest thing that tests your hypothesis
2. **Measure**: Collect data on customer behavior — analytics, interviews, surveys
3. **Learn**: Did the hypothesis hold? Pivot or persevere?
4. **Repeat**: Each cycle should be faster than the last

### MVP Strategy
- **Definition**: A functional product designed to test a business hypothesis with real customers
- **Goal**: Maximum learning with minimum effort
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for first MVP
- **Examples for KITZ users**:
  - WhatsApp catalog before building a website
  - Manual order tracking before CRM automation
  - Payment links before integrated checkout
  - Google Sheets before custom inventory system

## Agile Methodology

### Agile Values (Manifesto)
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Scrum Framework
- **Sprint**: Fixed time box (1-4 weeks, typically 2)
- **Roles**: Product Owner (what to build), Scrum Master (remove blockers), Dev Team (build it)
- **Ceremonies**:
  - Sprint Planning (what will we do this sprint?)
  - Daily Standup (15 min — what did you do, what will you do, any blockers?)
  - Sprint Review (demo what was built)
  - Sprint Retrospective (how can we improve?)
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **Best for**: Teams of 5-9, product development, feature-driven work

### Kanban Framework
- **Board columns**: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
- **WIP Limits**: Limit work-in-progress per column (e.g., max 3 items in "In Progress")
- **Pull system**: Pull new work when capacity opens, don't push
- **Continuous flow**: No sprints, work moves through board continuously
- **Best for**: Small teams (2-4 people), operational work, support teams

### Scrum vs Kanban for Small Business

| Aspect | Scrum | Kanban |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Structure | Fixed sprints | Continuous flow |
| Roles | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team | No prescribed roles |
| Planning | Sprint planning every 2 weeks | On-demand |
| Best team size | 5-9 | 2-4 |
| Best for | Product development | Operations, support |
| Overhead | Medium (ceremonies) | Low (board only) |
| **Recommendation for SMBs** | | **Kanban for teams < 5** |

### Scrumban (Hybrid)
- Combine Scrum's sprints with Kanban's visual management
- Use sprint boundaries for planning but Kanban board for execution
- WIP limits within sprints to prevent overcommitment
- Best of both worlds for growing teams
