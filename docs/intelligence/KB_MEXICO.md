## Tax

### SAT -- Servicio de Administracion Tributaria
- **Priority:** Critical
- **ID:** PKB-412
- **URL:** https://www.sat.gob.mx/
- **Why KITZ needs it:** Mexico tax authority: RFC registration, CFDI e-invoicing, ISR, IVA (16%), payroll

**Extracted Intelligence:**

SAT is Mexico's tax authority. RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes) is mandatory for ALL business operations: invoicing, payroll, banking, contracts, import declarations (since January 2025).

**CFDI Electronic Invoicing:**
- Mandatory for 100% of taxpayers (all sectors: companies, professionals, individuals).
- "Clearance model": invoice data transmitted to SAT in real-time for approval.
- CFDI 4.0 validates RFC in real-time during every transaction (names, addresses, compliance status).
- Includes tax amounts: VAT breakdown by rate, withheld taxes, totals.

**Payroll (Nomina):**
- Payroll complements mandatory for all employers: salaries, bonuses, benefits, deductions (taxes, social security).

**2026 Tax Reform (published November 7, 2025):**
- CFDIs must reflect genuine transactions.
- False/simulated invoices lose ALL tax effects.
- Criminal liability for issuers, recipients, AND intermediaries of false invoices.

**KITZ Application:** CFDI compliance is non-negotiable for any Mexico business. KITZ must help users understand e-invoicing requirements. RFC validation is real-time -- businesses must keep info current. 2026 reform adds criminal liability -- serious compliance risk.
