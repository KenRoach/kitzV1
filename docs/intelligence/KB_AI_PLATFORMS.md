Interpreting Across Time
How do properties of models emerge and evolve over the course of training?
Eliciting Latent Knowledge
As models get smarter, humans won't always be able to independently check if a model's claims are true or false. We aim to circumvent this issue by directly eliciting latent knowledge (ELK) inside the model’s activations.
Training LLMs
EleutherAI has trained and released many powerful open source LLMs.

Quantifying the Effect of Test Set Contamination on Generative Evaluations
Feb 16, 2026
arXiv
As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

Harvey
is a
generative artificial intelligence
(AI) product developed by the Counsel AI Corporation for the
legal industry
.
[
Note 1

The product has been described as a provider of customised
large language models
(LLMs) for law firms and in-house legal teams.

History
[
edit
]
Harvey was founded in the summer of 2022 by Winston Weinberg, who was a securities and antitrust litigator at
O'Melveny & Myers
, and Gabriel Pereyra, who was a research scientist at
Google DeepMind
and Meta.
Pereyra and Weinberg were roommates in Los Angeles. Pereyra was brainstorming startup ideas with his research colleagues. He showed Weinberg OpenAI’s
GPT-3
text-generating system, and Weinberg realized that it could be used to improve legal workflows.
They developed an early chain-of-thought prompt based on
GPT-3
, focused on California tenant law. They ran the model on 100 legal questions from a public forum and hired three attorneys to evaluate the answers and determine whether they could be sent to clients unchanged. Out of those 100 questions, 86 were approved. After that, Pereyra and Weinberg contacted
Sam Altman
and Jason Kwon, General Counsel at
OpenAI
, about their results.

Shortly after, on July 4, 2022, they met with OpenAI’s C-suite, and
OpenAI
became their seed investor. OpenAI also gave Pereyra and Weinberg early access to GPT-4.
Gordon Moodie, a corporate partner at
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
also joined Harvey in July 2023 as the company's chief product officer.

In March 2024, Harvey had 82 employees and stated that it intended to double that figure by the end of 2024. The company has reportedly hired a large number of lawyers, including from
White & Case
,
Latham & Watkins
,
Skadden
,
Gunderson Dettmer
,
Katten Muchin Rosenman
, and
Paul Weiss
. Harvey CEO Weinberg explained that many members of the company's sales team were formerly attorneys at '
Big Law
', i.e. large US law firms, and that the sales team's experience was useful in convincing at
