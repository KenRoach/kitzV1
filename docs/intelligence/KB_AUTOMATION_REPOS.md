Imagine visiting your repository in the morning and feeling calm because you see:
Issues triaged and labelled
CI failures investigated with proposed fixes
Documentation has been updated to reflect recent code changes.
Two new pull requests that improve testing await your review.
All of it visible, inspectable, and operating within the boundaries you’ve defined.
That’s the future powered by
GitHub Agentic Workflows
: automated, intent-driven repository workflows that run in GitHub Actions, authored in plain Markdown and executed with coding agents. They’re designed for people working in GitHub, from individuals automating a single repo to teams operating at enterprise or open-source scale.
At GitHub Next, we began GitHub Agentic Workflows as an investigation into a simple question: what does repository automation with strong guardrails look like in the era of AI coding agents? A natural place to start was GitHub Actions, the heart of scalable repository automation on GitHub. By bringing automated coding agents into actions, we can enable their use across millions of repositories, while keeping decisions about when and where to use them in your hands.
GitHub Agentic Workflows are now available in
technical preview
. In this post, we’ll explain what they are and how they work. We invite you to put them to the test, to explore where repository-level AI automation delivers the most value.
AI repository automation: A revolution through simplicity
The concept behind GitHub Agentic Workflows is straightforward: you describe the outcomes you want in plain Markdown, add this as an automated workflow to your repository, and it executes using a coding agent in GitHub Actions.
This brings the power of coding agents into the heart of repository automation. Agentic workflows run as standard GitHub Actions workflows, with added guardrails for sandboxing, permissions, control, and review. When they execute, they can use different coding agent engines—such as Copilot CLI, Claude Code, or OpenAI Codex—depending on your configuration.
The use of GitHub Agentic Workflows makes entirely new categories of repository automation and software engineering possible, in a way that fits naturally with how developer teams already work on GitHub. All of them would be difficult or impossible to accomplish traditional YAML workflows alone:
