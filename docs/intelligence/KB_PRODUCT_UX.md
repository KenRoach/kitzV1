How Cursor builds with Linear
At Cursor, ideas don’t wait. Someone drops a potential feature in Slack, and by the time most teams would have scheduled a meeting, Cursor already has a branch open.

How our Customer Experience team works in Linear
We integrate Customer Experience directly into Linear, so customers get clear answers and see their feedback shape the product.
Changelog
All updates
Feb 26, 2026
Deeplink to AI coding tools
Starting an issue used to mean manually creating a feature branch. Now it means assembling the right context so your coding agent can take a first pass. We've made this much easier to do in Linear.
Feb 12, 2026
Advanced filters and share issues in private teams
Refine your searches, views, and dashboards with advanced filters. Combine multiple AND/OR conditions to define exactly what you want to see.
Feb 4, 2026
Linear MCP for product management
We've expanded Linear's MCP server with support for initiatives, project milestones, and updates. These allow product managers to keep plans up to date and communicate progress from other tools like Cursor and Claude.
Jan 28, 2026
Time in status
Time spent in individual statuses is now tracked and available throughout Linear. Hover over any issue's status indicator to see the cumulative time it's spent in each status. You can use this to spot where things are getting stuck, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your development process.
