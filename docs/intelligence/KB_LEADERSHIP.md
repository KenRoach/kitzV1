Double-entry bookkeeping
, also known as
double-entry accounting
, is a method of
bookkeeping
in which every financial transaction is recorded with equal and opposite entries (
debits and credits
) - thus "balancing the books".

The purpose of double-entry bookkeeping is to maintain accuracy in
financial records
and allow detection of errors or
fraud
.

The basis of double-entry bookkeeping is the accounting equation:

s
=
L
i
a
b
i
l
i
t
i
e
s
+
E
q
u
i
t
y
{\displaystyle Assets=Liabilities+Equity}
Every transaction recorded will keep this equation in balance.  For example, if a company buys a new piece of an equipment (increasing an asset), it can spend cash (reducing an asset) or take on a loan (increasing a liability).  Based upon where an account sits within the accounting equation determines its
normal balance
- in this example, a debit to assets
increases
assets, whereas a credit to liabilities
increases
liabilities.
The use of double-entry bookkeeping is a standard process for tracking business transactions that improves the ability of the users of financial information to read, process, and understand the financial picture of a company's operations.  As the complexity and volume of transactions increases, companies use ledgers and
accounting information systems
to automate the tracking of individual transactions and to create
financial statements
.

DOWNLOAD MEMO
At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world, thrilling audiences everywhere. To do that, we’ve developed an unusual company culture focused on excellence, and creating an environment where talented people can thrive — lifting ourselves, each other and our audiences higher and higher. This document is about that culture, which is based on four core principles:
The Dream Team
We aim only to have high performers at Netflix — people who are great at what they do, and even better at working together.
People Over Process
You get better outcomes when employees have the information and freedom to make decisions for themselves. We hire unusually responsible people who thrive on this openness and freedom.
Uncomfortably Exciting
To entertain the world, we need to be bold and ambitious. That means embracing the thrill of what’s next — even when it’s uncomfortable.
Great and Always Better
We often say Netflix sucks today compared to where we can be tomorrow. We need the self-awareness to understand what should be better, and the discipline and resilience to get there.
While we don’t always live up to these principles, most people who join Netflix are pleasantly surprised by how great their colleagues are and the way we empower people at every level. As our business grows and evolves, our culture (and this document) will, too. What won’t change is our focus on excellence, and our determination to ensure that Netflix remains a place where great people can do the best work of their lives. If this sounds exciting, you’ll probably love it here. But Netflix is not for everyone, so please read on.
The Dream Team
We believe that what makes a fantastic workplace isn’t a great office or free meals and massages — although we have some nice perks. It’s the people. Imagine working alongside stunning colleagues who are great at what they do, and even better at working together. It’s why we model ourselves on a professional sports team, not a family. Families are about unconditional love. They can also be dysfunct

Disclaimer: The only social media platforms that Ray Dalio has official accounts on can be found below.
Ray Dalio
In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Over forty years later, Bridgewater has grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to
Fortune
magazine, and Dalio himself has been named to
Time
magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.
